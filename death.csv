  I saw my father die right infront of me in the ambulance and I couldn't do anything and there are many like me who must be unaware of what death is untill they see it themselves or someone very close to them die.You can prepare for an exam or competition, how can you prepare for Death? No one teaches you about Death.This is one topic where one cannot pull religion in between because it happens to all.. doesn't spare anybody..we burn the body & you bury it, what's the difference?Just like Sadhguru says that we were like dead before being born and we will be dead for a long time after we die, in the middle we live for just a small amount of time so we should live it consciously.I have so many questions that no one can answer, not even Google will help me this time..Just like how in the YouTube videos, the beauty with which Sadhguru explains and clarifies every question of ours, I am 150% sure that all my answers regarding Death will be answered..Thank You Sadhguru for everything that you are doing for us.I will post a re-edit/update later on this review after I get the book and I'm done reading with it.. can't wait

  An influential mystic who talks about life in great detail, a prolific writer, a torchbearer, I bow down to such a great soul. Namaskaram to Sadguru and all the readers.This review is about physical appearances of the book and most importantly how the books is structured, since I am yet to read the book.I pre-ordered the book and received it in just a day after it was released on 21 Feb. Thanks to Amazon for its reliable services. Paper and print quality is average, as it can be expected with Paperback edition of the book.Apart from Sadguru‚Äôs message on death this book contains few beautiful poems and spectacular images of Sadguru in different aspects of his life. I am a big fan of Sadguru‚Äôs poem commentary on different dimensions of life, nature, universe and so on.Let‚Äôs see what this book has to say. Reading is on...

  Yogi, mystic and visionary, Sadhguru is a spiritual master with a difference. He has got absolute clarity of thoughts. His perceptions and visionary ideas make him unique as a mystic, guru and mentor. It's a wonderful book that I would love to read.

  I am ardent follower of Sadguru. I am always impressed with his rational & logical thoughts. This is the only reason I bought this book. In this book he has written about existence of ghosts. It is vividly explained that ghosts do exist. It is further explained in detail about characteristics of these ghosts. This was not expected from Sadguru. What can't be proved by science and mathematics cannot be held true just because someone or Sadguru believes it. When Sadguru talks about non existence of God it is strange that he believes in ghosts. Come on Sadguru.

  This is the first ever time I've taken the effort to write a review for an amazon product, and really excited for it. The moment I knew about this book's release, I pre-ordered it and it was to be delivered on Feb24th Monday after 30+ from when I ordered it. Little did I know I would be at 2020's Mahashivratri event, and happened to buy a copy there itself, because I could not wait to read this book.My parents have been associated as Volunteers with Isha for 25+ years now, and I have finished some basic classes and read a few of his books and watched lots and lots of his videos before, but the content he touched in this books is super overwhelming at many places. In a joking sense, this is 100x of a Nolan movie that you might see. Blessed to live in an era where he is. Not yet a complete realized being, but one that knows for sure the current society and its mindset run by the egoic side is not real way of happiness.This book is TRULY for everyone who shall DIE!!

  The USP of Sadhguru is his ability to take the mystical and make it accessible. He ventures into topics considered obscure, even obscene often and makes them easy to understand. A reader or a consumer of his work will always be grateful for it.That being said, I do feel a bit underwhelmed by the book.Why?Because I expected it to be more than what I‚Äôve already known through his other books or videos. For me, the definitive book by Sadhguru remains ‚ÄòMystic Musings‚Äô followed by ‚ÄòInner Engineering‚Äô. As I read the book, it felt as if I already had heard it, read it before.However, to the ‚Äúuninitiated‚Äù, Death book will give you a lot of things to ponder, even shock and surprise you. I felt as if it were a deeply personal account of Sadhguru‚Äôs life(lives) and experiences.It may scare you, or it may alleviate your fears over death. It will though have an impact. Do read if you enjoy delving into the mystical, like me.

  You will not die in the end.You are dying every day! This books makes you aware about everything, one needs to know to lead a peaceful, successful and graceful life! Just go for it!I was born in Varanasi - one of oldest city on the planet, which celebrates death as the process and crescendo of life. I have always been interested in photographing pyre in my student life as I was living very close to famous Manikarnika Ghat on the bank of Ganga river. But till this date I have not witnessed death. No one left his her body in my presence. Though I have always been eager to witness that moment. Many years ago, I came across the book - 'Tibetan book of living and dieing by Sogyal Rinpoche . I liked the preface of the book but unable to read further (25 years ago).Then came Osho's book - Main Mrityu sikhaata hoon in Hindi language ( I teach death).Now I am reading Sadhguru's book - DEATH.I must tell you here that like millions of people on the planet- I am also a Isha Yoga practitioner since last 5 years. Completed all his courses.So in this review I have to share the following-* Sex and Death are the two taboos of the human race. and both are the natural.* We have read many books on Sex - now is the time to read one book on death too!* If you are and Isha Yoga practitioner - this book may reveal and explain many things about your daily practices.* If you are not yet a yoga practitioner- this will explain - why it is good to invest some time with your body and mind to have a peaceful death than leaving your body in a hospital. The book is very simple. As simple as Sadhguru's wit-full explanations you might have listened on youtube.The book also talks about - how one can help other people in the process of leaving the body.Essential read indeed!My favorite quote from the book-' When you left your body here and went to heaven. Without your body, what are you going to do with good food and virgins? '

  Read Before You Buy It!!A] Who should Buy It.....I recommend this book to everyone who is seeking truth of life and death. Who is willing to accept that 'I do not know' everything. All of you who have been listening to Sadhaguru on various social media platforms will find it mesmerising! üòäB] Who should NOT buy it.....I would recommend this to everyone but again I'm his follower, so let us talk about non followers.If you are someone who is interested in spiritual reading, occult practices/black magic, seeking answers for questions like what happens after death? From where have I come ? Is reincarnation possible ? What are ghost? Can someone influence my being through such occult practices? etc. But again let me warn you if you are not willing to dive beyond intellectual dissecting of every little thing and question every thing that you do not understand.

  Having read a lot of his other books, getting initiated in a couple of Isha programs - inner engineering and Hatha yoga, watching hours and hours of YouTube videos of him, there was still something that lacked. The rawness of what he is.

  I tend to like books in which information is properly organized & they contain specific informative.In my view,In terms of compilation, compiler of the book Swami Nisarga did a fantastic job. However, I feel he could have done better with the organization of the content.The index of the book was well thought out and one could actually read out what to expect from each section.However, in some section the speaker did speak less about the topic and end up advocating for a totally different topic. Eg: Topic: Couples for lifetime.It does give some good insights but I feel it creates more fear than hope as practical tools/ information provided is not enough. Considering the vastness of the topic, the compiler could have chosen to be more detailed instead of covering more topics.I rarely give 5/5 to any book. Consider my rating as that of a hard checker.

  This is a very comprehensive book about the Yogi's understanding of what death's true nature is.If you're a Indian, chances are high that you're familiar with the topics that are discussed in this book, but most probably not to the degree and depth to which they are explored here.Reading the index should give you a good idea about what the book is about, and it is about everything to do with death, including the human aspects like grieving to the more intangible spritual aspects.While it's a worth while read for everyone, it would be a even more intriguing book for a non-Indian reader.

  I don't think anyone can verbally justify the feeling once you finish reading the book. The information at times gets overwhelming but still keeps you wanting to learn more. I absolutely didn't expect Sadhguru to give out the details that he did in this book.The book may be titled Death but it sure makes you appreciate the value of life in all ways possible.For those who think this book is nonsense, I don't know what to say. Like Sadhguru says, ignorance is powerful! But it is unfortunate that we trust the modern sciences and technological advances more than our own ancient sciences that managed performing brain surgeries successfully thousands of years ago!It isn't about whether you follow him or you dont.. Just try and be more aware within yourself. You'll realize that what Sadhguru says, you already do know that! It ain't about believing as much as self dwelling.I cannot thank Sadhguru enough for talking about the essential aspects of science and not avoiding being unpopular.

  Sadhguru has done us a favour by publishing this book. Content of this book may appear orthodox to many but actually this is the most vivid explanation on 'death'. This book does not talk something different, because whatever is shared here is already told to us by our grand parents and parents but somehow they were not successful with their explanation or may be we were too naive to assimilate it. Nuclear families have drifted Indians far from their good old traditions. 'Death an inside story' will assist this generation in consolidating what is lost decades back.

  To be honest for past 4 or 5 years i have been looking for meaning of death and what happens after death. Ofcourse i can't talk about it with someone otherwise they will have negative notion about me. It is just me who is delving for more and try to be more aware about the concept of death. This book gave me various perspectives and i got my answers at some levels.The book is not a read for entertainment. In a video Sadhguru said, one must read the book in a few sittings. Digesting that much in a few sittings was hard for me. I am glad he has decided to go real deep and detailed here. This one goes beyond, sharing some not easily palatable details. Sadhguru with his astonishing skill to evoke ancient wisdom, juxtaposed with his keen insight into modern, contemporary life, the chapters roll along effortlessly.

  I had bought this book as soon as it was out in the market through Amazon but had not read it after Chapter 1 due to work commitments. I thought I could read it later when I get free. Even during the corona times, it never occurred to me the importance of such a book in my life, until recently.Only when my brother died suddenly in July of drowning, death came as a shock and reminder that anyone can die. As a young life, he exited so abruptly that I was not able to digest what happened. This book served as constant support when I was struggling with the loss of my brother. Reading this book made me emotionally stable and look at life afresh.I became aware of the life process and, most importantly, the truth of death as a natural phenomenon and not as a stigma. It is a must-read for all those who shall die; in fact, for all those who want to live life fully and die peacefully.- Britty Baby

  I have been wanting to read this book since its launch. But by reading the synopsis of the book, I thought lot of the content will go over my head. I thought it would be about various lokas like pitru lok, indra lok and all that. But having purchased and read the book last week, I found it an amazing read touching on all aspects of death in the journey of life. If you cannot live well at least learn to die well üôÇ. Yes, for people totally unexposed to eastern philosophy some chapters may seem very heavy. For those who are even little bit familiar of things like pancha bootha (5 basic elements) and prana, etc. it's relatively easy to understand. Having said that - there is a way to read this book. You need to trust the author on his immense wisdom and read with an open mind. Only then you can get the full benefit of reading this book. With our limited knowledge it is just not possible to imagine everything that is stated in the book. And just because we are unable to imagine does not mean that it's not true. Do not pick up this book if the purpose is to evaluate how well the author has written or how he has presented the facts and so on. You can pick up other books for the purpose. I have read a lot over the years but still the way this book presented new facts and new insights is amazing. Glad that I did not let it pass and purchased it.

  I have read other books of sadhguru and seen many discourses he has given. What generally happens in these is that he teases topics but due to a paucity of time, or due to the fact that people will not digest what he says properly, he does not go into great depth on many topics.This book is fundamentally different on that count. It is like a treatise on death and what is done around it. The scope of this book is incredible with so many ideas getting explored that it requires a second read at the very least. From infants to adolescents, from materially obsessed to mendicants, this book covers all aspects of death that I had thought to enquire about and much much more.It is my humble request to any reader of this book. Dont believe or disbelieve anything that is written. Just digest it and see where things go from there. There is little that we can show as ""proof"" for what is expressed in this novel, but it makes intuitive sense.In conclusion I will just say that I had no idea that death is such a deep subject and our yogic methods had such profound explanations for it. If you can keep your ideas aside and simply consume the book, the scope of things that you will learn in this book about death is truly incredible.

  Explored dimensions which are beyond the realm of science, but without this subtler aspect of the creation you and me would not acquire a body to make theories and conclusions about the universe. I've been scientific till 22 when something broke within me and I realised the limitation of science. I ventured into after life, near death experience, out of body experience, etc and nothing could settle me, lot of sleepless nights. And somehow started watching videos of Sadhguru but I was reluctant to listen to his words. At first science and spirituality sounded like polar extremes, then I started watching frequently, didn't settle my craving to know something beyond the body, though I enjoyed the wisdom cuz it gave me clarity in life. This hunger has led me to a point where I'm little loose my habits, my individuality etc and I'm left with a sense of dissolution.

To be honest, I couldn't digest all these stories with my rational appetite. I was expexting some philosophical food for thought on death & I am disappointed.

  Sadguru  has very explained  regarding death and rebirth and how to burst the bubble of life  and death and how become a big bubble that can be noticed. We all live  life  as if we are eternal but once we go through this book we come to ground reality that the loan we have taken from this earth is going to be repaid some day and this book also enables us to know  our karma and how we can burn our karma faster and burst out bubble  and escape being popping up again. It touches the core secrets of life and death  which is a very deep and profound  knowledge  which has been poured as a result of Sadguru multiple lifetimes of energy. I feel in Hindu tradition  they play bhagavath  Geeta when some one dies that can be replaced by the content of  this book coupled with Sadgurus magnetic  oration  which can touch and change many life's.

Very to the point but at the same time, extremely easy to understand. It reveals to you so many things you long to know. What's death or more importantly, what's life.. Why are we here.. Who we are.. Sadhguru's profound insights and wisdom has never been shared like this before.. Please do yourself a favor and order the damn book! :D :D

  No one is spared by death. Most of are afraid of death and avoid knowing about death due to fear it in their mind. However this unavoidable last part of our present life we are very little inclined to know in detail about it. Sadhaguru has given in-depth knowledge about it in this book to face death fearlessly and sail through it as event of spiritual journey further.

  As always, Sadhguru talks in detail and in-depth about life and what lies beyond life in this book. Those things which I used to hear from my parents and grandparents and disbelieve them, after reading the same things in this book, there seems no point in not believing them. One thing is definitely true that the human mind has its limitations and there are so many dimensions beyond us. A must-read book for all those who are interested in knowing different dimensions of life with an open mind.

  The book is comprehensive and written a little differently from the other books by Sadhguru. It's detailed, delving into various aspects of death, and dying. The book is not a read for entertainment.In a video he said, one must read the book in a few sittings. Digesting that much in a few sittings was hard for me.The book has had a transformational impact on me. My own awareness of my mortality has increased significantly, as I read the book...

  I'm getting to know the tools that Sadhguru offered in the book for those who shall die. For their death to happen peacefully, if not their life. One of the examples is given In seventh chapter: Assistance for the Dying.

  Positive thing about the book:The book is a good read for young people who needs to understand what happens after death and how it is viewed in hinduism and by our ancestors.Negative thing about the book:1. In some parts of the book, there is too much promotion for the death rituals offered by ISHA.2. There is no detailed mention about the rituals performed by Hindus for their ancestors. For example, the amavasya tharpana performed every new moon day of the month.Overall it's good book to read.

  I can promise you that it will help you a lot if you are a seeker types. There are few people like Sadhguru who try to put complex topics in much more simple manner. I suggest to read at least one or two books written by Sadhguru before reading this one. This book has lot of hardcore and raw stuff. ( as Sadhguru puts it - if you cannot digest then you will have to go to toilet )

  An apprently dreadful topic which makes people cringe at the very utterance of it has been addresses in such a smooth and settling way. It needed soo much clarity and that has been provided by sadhguru like never before. Such a mind bender this one. Must buy to broaden your understanding of death and gain more perspective on it.

  What I like about this book is the fact that it gives different perspectives on life and death. Questions like, Can we really define death? Are there ways of dying a good death? Is there life after death? are discussed.This book doesn't simply want us to agree with it. It wants us to question everything and not come to conclusions about anything.

  A lot of things written in this book Sadhguru has mentioned in passing before. But when I read it all at once, it was truly absorbing. Whatever it presented in this book, is out of most of our perception at this time. Whether we think the book is enlightening or hogwash is largely a matter of trust. Having been a practitioner of Isha Yoga for about 3 years now, things have improved dramatically for me. So, I only read with wonder at what kind of things are involved in designing the practices taught here and what Yoga is trying to achieve for us.Once I started reading, I have only stopped for eating and sleeping. It was enough to keep me awake for Mahashivratri :). If you are not into Yoga or any spiritual practice, this might either draw you in to explore or push you away. Either ways, I feel you must read it.

  I have never read any book apart from the school and college textbooks because I'm not interested in what someone thinks or believes or imagines. This book, however, was very interesting because of its name. I didn't expect that it will go that much deep into death. It does tell us about all those rituals that are carried out in India when someone dies, but what happens to that person itself is very fascinating.Now the book does touch on the subject which I never believed, but I can see that I was only dismissive about them just because I didn't know them. And in order to verify something or refute it, one needs to have a clear understanding of the subject and this book made me realize that I don't have it.It is true that we all have enhanced our outward sense organs or Karm-indriya (Like speech, hands, legs, etc), but we have not much enhanced our inward sense organs (like eyes, ears, nose, etc) than what it was when we were say 10-12 months old.The book does tell you about previous lives and things we all heard as legends and myths like ghosts and ghouls, which I have to admit I have never experienced, but it is also true that I don't remember any experience of me before I was say 3 years old.The book has definitely teased me to a world that is outside of my perception and I am very much looking forward to learning and practice to enhance my own sense perception to experience everything that Sadhguru has mentioned in the book.

  Picking up books to read in lockdown phase is quite a choosy task as we wish to read something which is very exciting as we are already sitting at home otherwise we generally tend to read light stuffs such as spiritual, meditational and peaceful pieces as we are already handling enough mess in our routine. Even after knowing this, I picked up the book I had been wanting to read since its release ‚ÄúDeath: An Inside Story‚Äù by Sadhguru knowing that it could have been depressing. The book also has the tagline that says ‚ÄúA book for all those who shall die‚Äù. I have watched many interviews of Sadhguru and whenever people asked him queries on death, rebirths, past lives etc., he would joke on it and move to the next question. I always thought that Sadhguru doesn‚Äôt believe in all this but this full-fledged book has come up like a surprise to me hence I was very excited for the same.Talking about Death, you would think that someone would end up explaining it within 40-50 pages and what else can be more about this thing which happens so suddenly that we don‚Äôt even come to know about it. Also, we think that Death is the end so why to think much about it. The most we want is to be healthy while dying. But Sadhguru here takes us to explain something about this one-word phenomena named ‚ÄúDeath‚Äù in around 375+ pages. That‚Äôs huge!I never believed that Living and Dying are two different experiences spiritually and I thought if we live well, our dying has nothing to do with it and our next life, if there is a thing like that, shall be on the basis of how we lived our previous life. Through this book, I have realized that how we even die and what happens to us immediately before that and even for days after we die, impacts our soul and energies and can be critical for it to survive peacefully post our death even if we have lived spiritually well. Sadhguru handles all the subjects with his humorous and awakening tone which makes It easy for us to go through the book even when few chapters are little heavy or depressing to grasp and digest.I was amazed with the concepts of multiple karmas, koshas, type of bodies, Vayus, chakras and how death happens in one of the stages in each of these concepts which impacts our energies later on. Sadhguru also doesn‚Äôt shy away from talking about concepts such as rebirth, re-incarnations, samadhi, mahasamadhi, ghosts, spirits, suicide, murder, memory after death etc. He also discloses about how his wife and several other close people around him left their bodies just like that on their will. He also talks about how body vanishes just like that for some people who are at the higher level to manage such phenomena.Jaggi Vasudev also lets us know about multiple other things such as how to identify if the person had a good death or not. How energies can be handled even after death. What rituals need to be performed in order to assure that the person who has died gets dissolved successfully. The great information that is shared is about how the person doesn‚Äôt completely die when he breathes his last but stays alive for few hours/days after that and hence can‚Äôt be called completely dead till then. Reading all this was very fascinating and knowledgeable. He also ends up talking about his previous lives and if he shall be taking rebirth again or not.Now talking about few drawbacks- I must say that this book is specifically meant for people who have already read or heard Sadhguru before otherwise understanding his language shall be very challenging. Secondly, most of the times Sadhguru doesn‚Äôt go into detailing just for the reason so that people get curious and go to Isha Yoga center or start taking his courses to understand things better. I believe if you are a spiritual person ‚Äì first of all your book should be free of cost ‚Äì if not that, at least don‚Äôt use it as a brochure for the multiple programmes handled by your foundation. Thirdly, few events that Sadhguru talks about like people leaving their bodies or burning and then vanishing immediately in front of him sounds fake because there‚Äôs no proof and we have not heard anyone sharing such events happening in front of them. I understand we are not that spiritually advanced to know if it‚Äôs bluff or true but still, things like these should be spoken with proofs or references. Also, I couldn‚Äôt agree with many things that he speaks about himself in terms of past life and how he has already lived more than required and he shall not be on the planet again.Overall, the book is thought-provoking and something that you have not read before- it‚Äôs like experiencing death before death. I give the book 4.5 stars out of 5. The book has information that shall really change the way you see Death- for yourself, your family or your closed ones. It shall not be scary anymore. Yes!Thanks.WRITING BUDDHA

  Before you read this book, remember that no one understands what the hell are electromagnetic waves and why does the double-slit experiment shows the result it does. How can light be a particle *and* a wave at the same time and what's up with black holes? But we still accept them as realities of this universe because the greatest minds among us agree on their existence. All I am asking is to go with an open mind and give equal consideration to the facts presented in there just like you would to any other scientific theory.Sadhguru has delivered a book where he goes beyond parables and metaphors and explains the nature of life and death itself. I am glad that Sadhguru has finally decided to give us unfettered access to the deeper secrets of the universe. If you don't wear your ignorance as a crown and keep an open mind, you would know how meek of an existence we are truly living and how much there is to explore. I hope Sadhguru continues to hit us with reality hard and shakes us out of this facade of maya.

  Death is that one of the topics which has never been talked about, discussed or written before. A topic, that is inevitable truth, going to happen to everyone born but while living, either life or life after death and beyond is only we have known or heard of. However, this very unique and much awaited book by Respected Sadhguru ji is something which would be needed for preparing our psychology and the way we perceive death in order to embrace it with grace and to overcome myths and orthodox surrounding it. Life is not just about living gracefully but also about dying gracefully with total acceptance.I will update my review after getting my copy of the book and reading it.

  #qotd :- self -help book really help us to discipline our life?...Death an insider story by shadhguru is really a taboo breaker , it clearlfy about every espect of life and death .Book is divided into three parts first is life and death in one breath second is the gracefulness of death and third is life after death.Everyone knows  that one day everyone's die but instead of that we take life as forgranted and after every small or big problems we starts calling death but death is so strong that it doesn't needs anyone calls .The day we really starts believing that one day we die and this is only moments to live ,our life become more easy .What is life and death , life after death , defination of hell and hevean this book contain everything that as a human we needs to know about.When I starts reading this book it seems like I am hearing shadhguru , like he is setting besides me and telling me everything.This book is for everyone for every creature in this world.So a big must read.

  Raw, direct and hard hitting, this is one of the best books by sadhguru. Usually whenever sadhguru says anything in public, he filters it up and presents it in such a way that it appeals to logical mind then says it. As a result, he skips over many details which leaves us wanting for more. Only with really intimate people he talks with a certain openness.This book is based on conversation with someone who was truely seeking the answers to these questions and deliberately sadhguru has refrained from polishing the language as now he feels is time for more direct conversation with larger audience. As a result he talks about many things that you might not have seen him talk about in such a way.This makes up a really good read from a mystic possesing extraordinary sense of perception.10/10. Would highly recommend it.

  There are a few ratings that complain about how this book talks about lot of nonsense without backing it up with science. Then there are others, who are just fans of sadhguru.The truth is this book is definitely VERY HEAVY. By heavy I mean, it contains lot of information about things we as humans probably find it hard to believe. The book is nice, no doubt. But you need to read those parts that are relevant to you, and that you can believe.There are parts on ghosts, again, some ppl might have a hard time reading. All I recommend is you read this book without judging it or accepting and rejecting concepts on the face of it. There are definitely things we are all not privy to, and it's always good to know more about our existence.But first, read it :)

  Most Enlightened masters only tell you to do some spiritual practices without really discussing the advanced technology behind it, like how it impacts your prana, reduces your karma etc. The very good reason for this is it is still not in our experience and we  would  either start making our own things in our mind, or be afraid of it.Sadhguru, whom I highly revere and see as a source of light for millions around the world  however consciously  chose to shed these inhibitions of trying to just have the people experience it than explaining the technologies behind spiritual process. In his book and other videos he kind of hinted that unless we are aware of our mortality, most of us will never turn in-wards (i.e. towards spirituality). Some might find temporary solace in cultural/religious beliefs purely as an after-life insurance to be in the company of God or your family here after.For most, especially not from Indian subcontinent things may or may not make sense. Even from India , most will not grasp or discard all as mumbo-jumbo, and that is still fine. No point making a 2nd grader believe or learn Quantum physics. I consider myself a 2nd grader as well when it comes to my very very limited understanding, even after may years of practice. But I know that this higher kowledge is something given by him in all compassion that atleast the curiosity of death or recognition of our mortal nature will drive people inwards.Not worthy of receiving it, but I thank him for providing it.

  Whole of global scientist fraternity has been bewildered for decades till now, on the double slit experiment related to quantum physics. Every human life has had at least one inexplicable moment which has out-rightly defied so called ""Scientific Logic"" !! Out of billions of incidents happening on a daily basis, these are but few, and out of the lack of generalization, we conveniently ignore them in the hindsight of ""practical living"", labeling them as some unexplained metaphysical or paranormal events. If favorable to us, how cleverly we claim their ownership bragging about our intuitiveness and sixth sense.This intuitive realm, the only hotbed of genuine creativity and compassion, extends infinitely all around our tiny speck of ego filled ""scientific logic, now getting fueled by Artificial intelligence"". So to truly comprehend this book in its entirety, one needs to muster enough courage to break free from their logical shell, and then every word of this book will find resonance within us beyond intellectual consumption.It's not just the praise for Sadhguru on inventing something out of generic context. What he has marvelously done, through his own experience, rather simplified the wisdom of what has already been documented in Vedas and Upanishads thousands of years back, for the quick and easy comprehension of masses. By wonderfully articulating all the intricate aspects of our human design related to death, not only he has successfully attempted to instill fearlessness against death, but also elicited the pristine beauty of life. So in hindsight, this book is actually about LIFE and encourages us to live it magnificently.Personally for me, it's been so liberating just to get this feeling that my whole life's shallow knowledge has come on one side and this book on other. Shat Shat Pranam to Sadhguru.

  This book truly opens up to what death is as well dispels misconceptions about it. It explains life in whole new dimension and allows for one to look at it as an immense possibility to discover. Well worth the read and should be in every household. The book is not about religion and belief but explores how death actually occurs how life leaves the body and what could be done to enhance it when it leaves the body. The book effectively dispels the myths of so called heaven and hell which might be a shocker to many however when one sees things for as they are it allows for freedom from dogmas and actual seeking out of truth vs accepting so called conventional thinking. Interesting is how to maintain dignity when one dies allowing for death to occur in a wonderful rather than harsh and disturbed manner.

  If you don‚Äôt know Sadhguru, well go see some of he‚Äôs videos on YouTube before buying this book. I‚Äôm not a book reader btw! I never read anything. I feel like all the books are just a reflection of people‚Äôs mind, but this book it‚Äôs a revelation. I mean, it‚Äôs beyond and beyond. If you already know him, there‚Äôs a lot of things that you won‚Äôt find on he‚Äôs YouTube videos that he actually explains in details in this book, so just buy it! And don‚Äôt worry about the 1-2-3 stars that people are giving, if I would have read this book a couple years ago, I would have give a 1-2-3 stars, because you have to be in a certain state of receptivity to actually gasp what he is explaining. Same if you‚Äôre watching he‚Äôs videos! But now I‚Äôm just speechless, best book ever !!! Better to read this than all the religious rubbish books out there lol

  Re-incarnation theory & Karma theory are the two fundamental tenets of Hinduism today. Also what you read in these new age books in the name of religion and spirituality is nowhere near the actual truth.If you debunk these two theories then modern day Hinduism being peddled by these new age gurus will fall flat on it's face. Incidentally Sadhguru is coming up with a new book on karma theory very soon. His own spin to the modern day spiritual mumbo jumbo

  More nonsense garbage from sadhguru.Look to OSHO for wisdom on any topic insted.The paper in this book is made of the same material they use in eastern Europe for toilet paper... I'm not surprised

  Pretty good book. Shed a different light on death for me for sure. Makes me consider the whole process of life in a different manner. Probably wouldn't ever read it again and would have a hard time recommending it to people as a good read

  An inside story? Indian rituals are not a secret. The only information about death, either the act of dieing or what happens after death is that Sadhguru does not have any deeper understanding of it than anyone else on earth.

  I was terrified and in complete disconnect from the world during the Pandemic. I was living in fear. This book is an eye opener and made me look at death with the same resonance as life.. To avoid death is to avoid living. Thank you Sadhguru for your insights on how to live well to die well.
