  As I invested 11 precious hours of my life on reading this book cover to cover ; I think I'm eligible to comment on its content . Then let me inform you friends that ""ANYTHING BUT CONTENT "" is present in this book . The book starts with a story at a pace so slow that it tests your patience to the extent of boredom . But I kept my patience and continued . And you know what I found ? Initial part of book is full of long insipid monologues and YOU CAN SKIP FIRST 8 CHAPTERS ( 26% OF BOOK ) WITHOUT ANY GUILT . The author present only vague data and fancy quotes copied from internet or bestseller books . There is NO SOLID , RELIABLE & PRACTICAL ADVICE as you expect from a (highly marketed ) Master called Robin Sharma . This is not a time management / life management book . It seems to be a boring travelogue of some eccentric rich person. The idea of its creators is "" WHEN YOU ARE LACKING A SCRIPT ; THEN CREATE A SCENE "" . Let me elaborate this . Here is a piece from masterpiece taken as it is . { An assistant wearing a crisp shirt the color of the sky and pressed Bermuda shorts the hue of a tomato, with red leather sandals, ran down from the home of the titan of industry. } I must tell you that almost 80 % of the book is full of such paragraphs where Cars , Helicopters , Beaches , islands , vineyards , female character's blouse fitting is discussed when you are expecting some life changing advice .  There is also a Non sense chapter on Taj Mahal . I want to ask the author what emperor Shah Jahan's (debatable) love for his wife has to do with my morning routine ?In the conclusion , I must say that author didn't put serious efforts while writing this book . When you are popular celebrity ; you develop a tendency to RELY MORE ON MARKETING & LESS ON CRAFT . And that's what Sharma Ji did . It is an avoidable book . Amazon's format doesn't allow my to rate anything lesser than 1 ; otherwise I wanted to rate it 0.5 .

  Hi, Robin, today is my 66th day of 5AC. and I completed the mission successfully. I really wanted to say thank you very much from the beginning of the Day1 but I just waited for this moment. During this 66day journey I encountered so many troubles and giving up scenarios but I always remember your words, ALL CHANGE IS HARD AT FIRST, MESSY IN THE MIDDLE AND GORGEOUS AT THE END. I really owned my morning and elevating my life..Few benefits I have gained during this journey : I never skipped from childhood but I always wanted to, but now I am skipping for 50 non stop... I even not able to solve one side of a Rubix cube but now I solve it completely within 3 mins... I am not at all a gym or running person, but now there is no day without them... As a professional, I am a research student working on Epigenetics(you know a few things about it). Now I am so fascinated to see how my 5AC helps to me in my research field...All in all, I AM REALLY THANKFUL FOR YOU FROM MY BOTTOM OF MY HEART,‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è for writing the masterpiece and sharing valuable ideas of 5AC...BTW, I met you on my 43rd day at Mumbai, and you said it's amazing.. üòÉüòÉüòÉ

  Ever since I joined PGIMER, Chandigarh as a postgraduate resident, automatically I had become a life member of 5 AM Club.  Whatever I am today, I attribute it to this 'keystone' habit of mine.  Robin Sharma's new book, ""The 5 AM club"" has further reinforced my belief in rising early in the morning.Robin Sharma has emerged as a master storyteller ever since his first book ""The monk who sold his Ferrari,"" published way back in 1997.  I read that book sometime around the year 2000.  And ever since then, I have become his ardent fan.  I have the entire collection of his books, and personally, I have been benefitted in every walk of my life.  (I hope he does not ask for a royalty!)Robin created a lot of buzz around this new book for the past four years, and he has lived up to the expectations.  ""The 5 AM Club"" is not a story.  It has all the lessons required to succeed in our personal, family and professional lives.  Robin compels us to change for better, with his signature quote, ""Change is hard at first, messy in the middle and gorgeous at the end.""  He has introduced several innovative infographics to help readers understand his masterly concepts as he passionately narrates his story.  There are also several cinematic twists and turns to keep the readers bound to the book.  And of-course there are many of his game changing formulas.  The book can easily be made into a motion picture as it follows  Aaron Sorkin's 3-act structure.  And now Robin has become a poet also! There are 2 - 3 beautiful poems.Here are the three most important take-home messages for me from this brand new Robin's page-turner:1. ""Life's is too short to play small with your talents.""2. ""Your excuses are seducers, your fears are liars, and your doubts are thieves.""3. ""The moment when you most feel like giving up is the instant when you must find it in you to press ahead.""Robin has been my Dronacharya, and I hope this review of this Ekalavya for his book will be an apt Guru Dakshina (Royalty!).Dr. Prahlada N.BChitradurga.

  Title looked attractive the reason I pre-ordered for it. But it did not create interest from beginning.....starting with protagonist's desire to commit suicide....that too by taking a 'gigantic bottle of pills' (typical problem of substance abuse found in the developed world, as per the World Happiness Report-2018)! Okay, may be the writer has tried to show the importance of his ideas by starting with extreme negative!Secondly, the book seems promoting his profession as 'motivational speaker' where he is most in demand!Actually, the book seems targeting the audience of western world who have seldom been taught the importance of waking early in the morning (though 'early to bed & early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise' is a western old proverb!).....! But it ""fails to impress"" the typical Indian following Ayurvedic and Yogic way of life where waking up by 3am (Brahmamuhurt) is followed! May be advising for waking up by 3AM would have very difficult to follow in the western world as people remain awake late night!This is another thing that very few Indians today wake up early morning or before sunrise at least what to ask at 3am! For this we can also blame the western development model promoted by the World Bank/IMF, influenced by specially the USA...! This development model gave rise to a different lifestyle in which waking up early from bed was not professed. A time came when whole world aspiring the so-called process of development somehow started following 'the American way of life' (the way of life which was suggested by the experts USA to change to protect environment and reverse the process of climate change at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, 2002. This was bluntly and shamelessly rejected by the then US President J W Bush saying American life is not made for compromises!). So, we have an imposed lifestyle and have forgotten our indigenous knowledge of living our life. Robin Sharma from this perspective is doing great job- teaching Americans to change their lifestyle. This will make citizens of other countries also to change their lifestyle.In India, already the IT industry in Bangalore has started facing the crisis (losses running over 3 billion US dollars) due health and substance abuse issues of the IT professionals......as most of them dream/copy the US lifestyle. For such people this will be a ""good book"", undoubtedly.Had this book been written more concisely it would have left better impact as the old wisdom of 'early to bed and early to rise' is ""strongly"" backed by recent scientific research and proofs!

  n The 5 A.M. Club - an entrepreneur, an artist and a homeless man meet at a seminar held by a spell-binder. All three require different things and are present there for their personal reasons and to gain positivity in general. Little did they know that their life is going to be changed forever. With a few twists and turns here and there, Robin Sharma has tried to make this Self-Help a mixture of both Fiction and Non-fiction. This book mainly tells you the importance of early rising and utilizing the first hour of the day to gain more success in every field of life along with other concepts.I was pretty excited for this read to see how Sharma has helped us utilize the early morning time more efficiently but discovered that is is not just about it.Coming to the language, it is artistic, which is unusual for a Self-Help but this also makes the book a little stretchy. The book is well-structured.While it has many concepts that are life-changing, I was pretty disappointed because I got lesser than anticipated when compared to the number of pages I read. A few chapters were entirely irrelevant to the title of the book and an avid Self-Help reader my also find repetition of some content.However, the concepts given in the book, if implemented can change your life in a practical manner to get a world-class life. One suggestion - check out the index and read chapter wise to save time.In the end, I suggest this book to the people who like a mixture of fiction and Non-fiction or to the beginners of Self-Help Reading.

  It is by far the worst book written by Robin Sharma.It might become his career killer.Book contains truckloads of nonsense,  need less philosophy, unrelated quotes and almost no practical advise except to convince reader to wake up at 5 am in morning on every page.After reading book it feels like Robin Sharma started believing that his book readers are dumb and fool and he can feed them any kind of crap.Completely irresponsible work from my most favorite author. If same book would written by any new author , it won't get published even for free.Don't waste time on it. Instead you can read Monk who sold his Ferrari once again ,which will give you better returns in productivity in life even if you have read that many times.

  The reason, I am writing this review is I just read a few extremely negative comments and I felt so bad.What Robin has tried to achieve through his words on a paper is penetrating the tons of Junk Layer on our minds and heart and trying to take us towards the real meaning of our life and discovering our true potentials and shaping new ourselves. If you are looking for a fairy tale and thriller or some drama fiction, this book is definitely not for you. I would say this book will definitely test and make you question yourselves a lot of things and will definitely make you understand where the significance lies.Plus, I have seen reviews about the fiction(boring, unrelated) used in the book.Well, this is all about your interception, and people are different and they understand things differently and Robin has tried to create various images in our mind and has let us choose the scenarios that we want in our life while focusing on the things which will elevate anyone's life.And, it totally depends on you, that, how you intercept and absorb all that knowledge about mastery and evading mediocrity.One last thing, most of you guys reading these reviews are the ones craving for ""success""/""money""/ or in a very rare case ""peace"".This book preaches all three of them.

  I am avid reader and read anything which can be read and give some insight in life. During that reading, i came across the book, ""A monk who sold his ferrari"" by Robin Sharma; almost a decade back. I became fan of him. I read few self improvement book before it; like you can win, who moved my cheese, who ate my cheese, eat that frog, rich dad poor dad etc. But i preferred fluidity and easy concept by robin sharma. I have heard more than 80 you tube lectures from Robin Sharma, almost more than 3 times each. I read so many notes from robin sharma nation.This whole introduction, just to say; i am long time follower of Robin Sharma.Then since last 6 months, waiting for this book 5 am club. I preordered it .In his typical language, i am going to deconstruct his book. I read it taking good time. Few chapters, i reread for better under standing. For few chapter; i have made few simple notes to avoid lengthy story line. So after reading his book, after following him from more than a decade; these are my views.First and foremost, any read which is non digital, is better. So better to grab a book. Reading always gives a new dimension to same thing which has been told in you tube or read on net by same author. Diagrams are fabulous things in whole book. I printed few diaphragms and stuck on my room wall. Reading slow makes thing wonderful for book like this, as few things are really crowded. I mean so many things in one or two page, and nothing to grab for two more page. One need to makes some notes in last 70 pages. It is relatively easy read linguistically, but not as fluid as A monk who sold his ferrari,Who should read and digest this book: In one line, this is a book for people who believe that  discipline is worst thing in life. This book will explains you importance of discipline, how disciplined one hour in morning lead you to planning your whole day, week and life, and how you can fulfill your complete family and professional life satisfactorily. Scientific basis of everything is explained wherever possible and needed. Hardest part of book, is implementing principles in real life. And as Robin Sharma used to say; all changes are hard at first, messy in middle and gorgeous at the end.After hearing 80 lectures; more than 3 times each, reading almost everything on robinsharma.com; this book sometimes feel repetative. Actual principles of 5 am club, starts in last 70 pages. Reading is always better than listening pod casts or viewing you tube videos; but still. Except those diagrams, which are extremely helpful, all contents i have heard in a way or other in podcasts and youtube.But still i read this book and willing to read 2-3 times more if i can get something more .Rating is just based on my expectations.

  So, after finishing the book, i felt like it was too early for me to judge the book and its content but now I can definitely say this book is really a GEM!yeah I agree ,  in the beginning you might feel a bit frustrated, dried out and bored because of the fictional story and too much of ""talk-talk"" but believe me keep reading it. Robin Sharma has definitely put in some hard work and has tried his level best to put forth all the principles needed for a successful 5 AM routine with detailed explanation and scientific reasoning.Though it might sound boring in the beginning NO ONE can deny the fact that this book is a total game changer!Once you start the book it will be difficult for you carry it forward, after sometime when reached in middle you'll feel its too much for to comprehend but as you approach the end you will definitely realize that all the effort you put in was WORTH!After finishing the book I realized that his quote, "" Change is hard in the beginning, messy in the middle and gorgeous in the end"" fits aptly for his book !! I would definitely recommend this book for any one who want to change their lives drastically.GO FOR IT ! !

  Reading this author for the first time, I guess I had high expectations being a best seller and all. I found it to be like a bollywood plot which had few portion of self help pieces force fitted into it.  I just thought it was such a waste of time, reading through some over dramatic, saccharine (enough to give me diabetes) plot, over loaded with quotes from many others to share about something perhaps we already know (our parents n grand parents may already be following). All said, it would have been a good book if it had just been a non-fiction with crisper content. I was heavily disappointed to have been misled to it being a great book (it may possibly appeal to people who haven't read non-fiction and want to try a story with a lesson).

  I have loved reading Robin Sharma's books over the years, so was quite disappointed to get this kind of a book from him. It starts off weaving a story as is usually the case with his books, but very soon I totally lost interest. When you buy a book with such a title you would expect to get motivated in the initial chapters. But it just kept on with a boring story line and a bunch of characters. I eventually didn't even get to reading about the 5 AM club, just put the book aside. Waste of money.

  With high expectations, I purchased this book and read from cover to cover. It is total trash. After many best-sellers, it seems an author forgets that the readers will not be taken in by tomfoolery.This book talks of an eccentric billionaire who wants to show off to his pupils his knowledge of exotic locations like Rome, Mauritius, Latin America and so on. With doves that appear from nowhere and miracles of footmen coming on the scene, the author dazzles you with imagery, without contributing anything original. The chapters are full of quotes from all over the world and quaint images of author's imagination.Don't waste your money on this book.

  As Robin Sharma's other books, his profound words resonates within. His willingness to go an extra mile to elevate people's life through the 5 Am club is extraordinary. As you start reading the book you get fueled by the thoughts and the possibilities of owning the morning but few extra details distract you from the main topic i.e break the rhythm. Yet keep going its an great book to push you out of your comfort zone and give a taste of essence of life.

  Author Robin Sharma has very beautifully summed up the important ideas backed by latest research and crafted this masterpiece to add value to the lives of people who does not have time to craft their lives in every aspect as they would wish to. We all long for betterness in our lives. The book motto is - ""Own your Day. Elevate your life."" So, robin specifically talks about Victory hour (5am - 6am) and important concepts like Cognitive bandwidth, Flow, Sleep optimization, Habit formation and Digital Detox that revolves around owning the early morning routine so that we have a great day ahead. He believes that Pain in the society is there because that potential inside us has not been given space to turn it into Mastery. So, by owning our days we can elevate our lives and in-turn the lives of others.Also, it includes a great collection of world class quotes like""If you plan on being anything less than who you are capable of being, you will probably be unhappy all the days of your life"" ~ Psychologist Abraham MaslowIf you love quotes, self growth or want to have better days in general, this book will surely fire up your neurons.

  Updates now that i completed reading the book: The essence of the book's measages is concentrated Chapter 14 onwards. Rest just builds up the context/drama. Few pages like 235 carry diagrams with fonts so small that you need a magnifying glass to read.I have read 46 pages, reached mid of Chapter 5, and all that the author has been trying hard so far is to communicate that rising everyday at 5AM could be a game changer. I have read several other titles from the author but this one is really really weird. I mean, 3 strangers meet at a motivational speaker event, one of them is a filthy rich dud with a private island, helicopter, dolphins and stuff and this guy offers 2 other complete strangers a fully paid trip to his island, a pick up via his private jet, so that he could teach them the 5AM morning ritual. It seems that the author has gone overboard in literally assuming his readers to be some pot smokers just sitting and waiting to hear his Alice-in-the-Wonderland kind of narrative in which anything goes, literally anything. I am quite annoyed.

  The 5 AM Club is another pearl of wisdom offered by legendary leadership and elite performance expert Robin Sharma. The best and most powerful message I achieved through this book is the Mindset, Heartset, Soulset and Healthset.Applying this principle has helped me personally in a big way. For example, I could author a book for the first time. Simply crafted, this book radiates very powerful messages inspiring readers to elevate their lives phenomenally. It illustrates how the world‚Äôs geniuses and legends are born out of this simple yet extreme discipline which is a scientifically proven to influence neuroscience and your personality.Practising this habit can enable your personal growth in a phenomenally different manner. Its powerful messages give you the keys to unleash the immense potential locked within you by ignoring digital distractions and trivial diversions with an ultimate objective to dive head first towards enabling your magnificent impact on the world around you.Packed with profound wisdom yet so lucid in flow, I simply love this book and find it a priceless asset straight from Robin‚Äôs heart.Thanks Robin for influencing my heartset, soulset, mindset and healthset through the 5 AM Club.

  It's not an original copy, its a photocopy, better to read it on kindle, one buys a hardcopy for the feel of the book, but just to make a markup people don't advertise that and that's not right, bok itself is a good one but there are points where pictorial representation is needed and that's just pathetic in quality takes away the entire feel of reading an actual book is just sabotaged

  I read the other reviews here and I would agree that the story is a tad bit stretched and gets hard to get through. BUT, it‚Äôs most definitely motivational. I‚Äôve bought Robin Sharma‚Äôs course in the past and seen endless videos, read many articles he‚Äôs written. What I loved about this book was that it repeats the best wisdom he‚Äôs shared over the years in one place. Yes, some might find it repetitive, but guess what Robin Sharma says about repeating good information? It starts to drill itself into your mind, the more you repeat it! I‚Äôve not even finished reading the book but already finding it inspirational. And I love how all his best quotes have been incorporated into the story. Yes, it‚Äôs a heavy often slow read. But if you picked this book up to get classic RS motivation on waking up early, you will get it.

  I usually don‚Äôt read this kinda of books(First 50 pages of U can achieve this and that blah blah) initially while reading I was hoping for author to move ahead with story but all I got was quotes , some over explanation of who wore what clothes and all , i understand that some writing is required for characters personality to portray but this was way too boring and cliche. I‚Äôll be honest - I read book around page 265 , I couldn‚Äôt bear the Bollywood style implementation of story telling. Basically I  Would sum up this book for - if u are someone who gets motivated by quotes , inspiring fictional stories then you might like this book.

  It‚Äôs so sad that this book should have been a podcast or something and would have made such a massive impact. It‚Äôs got great stuff but spends close to a 100 pages advertising itself. I‚Äôve already bought the book! I don‚Äôt need more encouragement to buy into the idea.You get tired of reading ‚Äòown your morning, elevate your life‚Äô over and over again without actually getting to the ‚Äòhow‚Äô and the fiction adds nothing of value to the book. What it is is basically a collection of quotes and bits and pieces of the process. Would have been excellent even as a workshop but should never have become a book.However, I give it three stars because the actual useful stuff is pretty useful. So if someone can sit through the boring lectures, the takeaway is useful.

  The 5 AM Club: Own Your Morning, Elevate Your Life Is a good book for personality development. The book provides a great morning routine to follow for maximum utilization of self. The morning routines are well defined and very compelling. The book provides numerous quotes and trivia facts that makes you think and puts your mind to work. The book explains a story of two individuals who desperately need to better their lives and unexpectedly go on an adventure with billionaire who sharpens them up and teaches them the morning routine. The story isn‚Äôt well constructed and I personally questioned the presence of the plot. There is a strong fluctuation  between the plot and the learning element which could have been better. A bit confusing at times. Nonetheless, a great book for finding the perfect morning routine.

  The best book, starting is a bit slow but from 8th chapter onwards there's a lot of wisdom and new techniques given by Robin.... I am reading chapter 12 now and I realize why Robin said that he wrote it with his sweat.......Don't just judge it by 1st some chapters bcoz miracles are hidden after chapter 8th...And the various techniques he insisted in it they r awesome.....What's simplification in life?We just always get confused that simplification depends on externality,  how we wear or behave or show to others but in my life I just redefined this term by the blessing called the #5AMClubSome lines on simplifying-"" simplify,  streamline everything. Become a purist.  Less is really more.  Concentrate on just a few work projects so you can make them amazing versus diluting your attention on too many.  and socially have fewer friends but go deeper with them so the relationship is rich.  Accept fewer invitations,  major in few leisure activities and study,  then master,  a small number of books versus skimming away. An intense concentration only on what matters most is how pros realize victory. ""

  Full of unnecessary stuff and too lengthy. I think what Robin Sharma could have done in just abiut 75 pages has been stretched to into 300 pages. The charecters in the fable too much filmsy to identified with. Agreed that waking up at 5.00 AM is good habit and lot of people wake up even at 4 AM and follow the kind of things that Robin Sharma recommends but do all of them become Ambani or Adani ? On the contrary lot of guys who go to bed at 2.00 AM and wake up in the afternoon and yet produce excellent results in whatever they do.

  Yet again Robin Sharma has come up with a masterpiece. The book does show that years of hardwork has gone into the making. Good insights which can be practically followed and the best part is you are able to relate to his writing.Only slight dislike is when the author tries to dramatise the situation, Robin obviously is not a fiction writer and should stick to what he does best.

  Why Sharma takes this approach is perplexing. No matter how valuable his thoughts and insights are ‚Äì and there‚Äôs some really good stuff here on defending yourself against digital distraction, the ¬≠neuroscience behind daily exercise and the small yet fun steps to increasing productivity and, ultimately, happiness ‚Äì hiding them behind completely unrealistic characters and dreadful storytelling seems completely bizarre.

  Genre- Motivational/ Self-helpWriting style - Narrative + InformativeClap-clap - Tolstoy wrote,'everyone thinks of changing the world but no one thinks of changing himself.' Become a bigger person and you'll automatically become a better leader- and a greater producer. And yes, I agree that growth can be scary. But my mentor once taught me that 'the part of you that clingsto fear must experince a sort of crucifixion so that the portion of you that deserves high honor undergoes a kind of reincarnation.' Those are the exact words he shared with me. Freaky and deep, right?Description- Not every book needs to have a romantic story to make it famous and deep, there are writers like @robinsharma who creates a masterpiece with his work and this book believe me, will force you, exhilarate you to get up and get moving, more faster than you can ever imagine.His work is to die for and what an amazing author, if not books follow him and listen to his podcasts. This book will keep you up and get going, that's about it. No actually it's a big journey, which will makes it easier to complete the journey.

  This book shows that you just need a topic first and than write anything relating to it and explaining it as much as you can by using invaluable stuff. He created a fiction around the word ""5am"".

  The author has researched a lot maybe and has given very much valuable and intresting information which can be used to elevate your life but the drawback is the book has a lot of drama included to as the author takes his own pace to explain us the things.

  Its written more like a novel, good for casual readings, sort of engaging, but gives a lot of illusions of life, its over stuffed with unnecessary stories.Tries to hype up the lessons but, what I honestly felt, its quite simple and most people do appreciate it but you need to give consistent multiple readings to have a take away that's unique from the book.Not a good suggestion for matured people.

  Many of us do not realize the power of morning magical hours.  Robin has crafted this book in such a way that it inspires you to wake up at 5 AM and get most from your life. Most of the self-help books just inspire you by the time you read them, but this one is different. Robin is making it sure that we are following  5AM ritual for the lifetime.  why? becase as he says: ""this world needs more heroes.""  20-20-20 formula (from this book) is winning one.

  Biggest Kachra from Robin Sharma there is 5 pages enough to write down core ideas of book.How long Robin will be utilized his fable like The monk who sold his Ferrari.

  You can find many add ons and many supporting articles in this book ‚ÄúThe 5 am Club‚Äù. But this doesn't mean that the whole book is not worth reading. The 5am phenomena and its benefits are taught by a Successful Billionaire Businessman and his Mentor Spellbinder who is a motivational speaker. Both these characters are imaginary and their students an Entrepreneur and an Artist are also. The duo got married in the end of book. Robin Sharma write this book in the same way like he wrote ‚ÄúThe Monk who sold his Ferrari‚Äù like a fiction.

  Highest price-240‚ÇπLowest price-190‚ÇπBook condition-greatFollow me, interesting stuffs coming soonAs I invested 11 precious hours of my life on reading this book cover to cover ; I think I'm eligible to comment on its content . Then let me inform you friends that ""ANYTHING BUT CONTENT "" is present in this book . The book starts with a story at a pace so slow that it tests your patience to the extent of boredom . But I kept my patience and continued . And you know what I found ? Initial part of book is full of long insipid monologues and YOU CAN SKIP FIRST 8 CHAPTERS ( 26% OF BOOK ) WITHOUT ANY GUILT . The author present only vague data and fancy quotes copied from internet or bestseller books . There is NO SOLID , RELIABLE & PRACTICAL ADVICE as you expect from a (highly marketed ) Master called Robin Sharma . This is not a time management / life management book . It seems to be a boring travelogue of some eccentric rich person. The idea of its creators is "" WHEN YOU ARE LACKING A SCRIPT ; THEN CREATE A SCENE "" . Let me elaborate this . Here is a piece from masterpiece taken as it is . { An assistant wearing a crisp shirt the color of the sky and pressed Bermuda shorts the hue of a tomato, with red leather sandals, ran down from the home of the titan of industry. } I must tell you that almost 80 % of the book is full of such paragraphs where Cars , Helicopters , Beaches , islands , vineyards , female character's blouse fitting is discussed when you are expecting some life changing advice . There is also a Non sense chapter on Taj Mahal . I want to ask the author what emperor Shah Jahan's (debatable) love for his wife has to do with my morning routine ?In the conclusion , I must say that author didn't put serious efforts while writing this book . When you are popular celebrity ; you develop a tendency to RELY MORE ON MARKETING & LESS ON CRAFT . And that's what Sharma Ji did . It is an avoidable book . Amazon's format doesn't allow my to rate anything lesser than 1 ; otherwise I wanted to rate it 0.5 .

  This is book is one of the book I have ever read till now. This book can transform a person's life to its better extent. It could be a doorway to new realms of happiness. We might not believe in rising up early as per today's generation but trust me..  It is true to say that early bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise. Hope you people will love it too.

  Mr. Robin Sharma wrote a book on waking up early.Seems like he's running out of worthy ideas and writing a 300+ pages book on waking up early.I remember there is a chapter on the benefits of waking up early in his own book, ""Who will cry when you die.""Any human with normal knowledge can easily understand that, there is no need of a book on it.I'm on his mailing list and before the release he was always saying that this is his greatest work.It took him 5 years to write the book.Guys, waking up early is one of the best habits you can ever gift yourself.""I have always been an early riser all my life. To wake up early, do some studying, when I was a student. Now it is reading, writing, meditating and then go for a walk and watch the sun rise.The striking patterns of hue could be seen during twilight and just after sunrise. It is mesmerizing and I can never have enough. Each time it appears to be new. Indeed, nature is the most creative painter of this universe.I fell in love with sunrise and my mind promptly used to wake me up right at the time each day before the break of light to catch that one glimpse of the most glorious part of the day.""You should value your time and money by not buying the book and instead experimenting with waking up early.See for yourself the changes it will bring in your life.Thanks for reading my review.PS: I've no hard feeling for RS.I had been reading his books from his very first one.But the quality of the content is decreasing and he is being made famous by digital marketing and false promotions.This does not suits a life coach.

  I am an ardent fan of Robin Sharma and have been reading his posts and watching videos religiously since few years now. And have been trying to put his tips to use.So, back in 2014, Robin Sharma had started this 5AM club on facebook and I had joined it immediately. When this book came in, I decided to read it at the beginning of the year so that I can put the learning to use and be sorted for the year.Sad part is - it has nothing new for me. (And yet I am struggling to be a part of this 5AM club)Good part is - it has all the useful stuff that Robin Sharma has been selflessly sharing every day over these years. This book is kind of a reference book you will want to read and use many times. It will take years to put that to good use.Major flaw I find in the method proposed by him - is this assumption that you are alone or you have many assistants to manage your family and other daily mundane stuff, because that is not taken care of in the book. Specially for Indian Women. Men can still put the stuff he mentions in it to use and become a part of this 5AM club. But unless there are many hands helping the indian woman to take care of their family duties, 5AM club is only good in print. (I am thinking of writing 5AM club for Indian Women :D)The book emphasises on putting time for yourself - for exercise, meditation and planning the day and dialogue with self on the goals.Lot of motivational snippets in the book that really pump you up even if you have listened to him many times.So, even if you don‚Äôt want to get up at 5 AM, you can still use the tips given in the book. The book is more like a gist of all his videos.My reco - read it and use it!

  This is my first Robin sharma book. I always wanted to read self -help books but something would stop me to take the pilot step. When I read the blurb , thought to give a shot as it sounded more of fiction kind than self help.I wouldn‚Äôt t say that I am disappointed, it was good read but definitely not a great read. Few chapters were really noteworthy . As a representation model it was fun to go through but with the detailing it lost the charm as it proceeded.The first few chapters had quotes and phrases of other genius people. Believe me I liked the first 100 pages as it inspired me to read further with all those quotes. The homeless man seemed to be more inspiring than Mr.Riley.The book basically focuses on enhancing your potential and productivity throughout the day and even through out your life. The book exhibits the models and practice to follow which helps to overcome our fear and insecure thoughts. These all could be done by waking up when the world is sleeping, the ultimate 5AM .To prepare yourself to face the day ahead more efficiently.Our subconscious mind always falls prey to the society pride. We do what the society expects from us. The book perfectly gave the insight about our addiction.The book went on with too much of concepts. It‚Äôs not just waking up by 5AM so you have lot to fuel your mind with practices and techniques. But these facts concentrated more on to the management sector or business people. At times I felt this is not for the common people.I found the second half of the book to be bit dragging and too detailing. May be this book is not for everyone but for only who believes in 5AM.Overall ‚Äù The 5AM Club‚Äù is fascinating at few places and instances but fails to get hold of us completely through the process.

  ‚ÄúLimitation is nothing more than a mentality that too many good people practice daily until they believe it‚Äôs a reality‚Äù ‚Äì Robin SharmaProductivity is a highly misinterpreted concept often leading people to despise the lives they‚Äôre living. We can‚Äôt blame them. Society has taken lessons for us that often lead to our destruction rather than our success. It is up to us to either follow the crowd or lead it. It‚Äôs not easy; those who think it is are only fooling themselves. If we can face our demons and rise to a level where we can never come back down, we‚Äôre unstoppable.‚ÄòThe 5 AM Club‚Äô is a book that teaches the importance of making your morning enriching so that your entire day is a productive one. The main motto it follows is ‚ÄòOwn your morning, Elevate your life‚Äô. The other aspects it highlights:1) the destructive use of technology2) rewards of perseverance3) detrimental effects of distractions4) achieving granularity5) neuroplasticity6) the excellence and refueling cycle7) installing a habitAnd many more.The writing style of the book was not good, to be honest. There was an indefinite shifting of tenses; while the author was trying to focus on making it a fiction/self-help book, the references made to readers shouldn‚Äôt have been added. Also, the borrowed quotes from famous people made the book feel ungenuine.This book is solely for people who seek high productivity and those working jobs. It is not for students and those reading it for the sake of literature. But pro-tip to students, even though most of it might not be applicable, getting up at 5 AM does help in making our endeavors possible. Give it a read and use those techniques which seem most reliable.

  There are two reasons I picked up this book. One of them was because I was curious to read a book by this author, Robin Sharma, whom I had heard so many great things about. But the more important reason was because the topic of the book addressed a personal problem area that I have been working on for a long time, which made the book a perfect fit for me. Or so I thought.But I was clearly wrong, because this book, on many levels, was what you'd call an unmitigated disaster. So much so that I don't even know where to start with the review or the problems.But I guess, let's begin with the expectations vs reality -So.. I had expected a pretty straightforward book with actionable tips and solid advice. This was the exact opposite.For starters, Mr. Sharma chose to make his case through the means of a fictional story. Which by the way, is clearly not his forte, because it was a terrible story, that stood out for what it truly was - an awkward and ineffective plot device.And if that wasn't bad enough, the actual content (in this case, advice shared by a business mogul - part of the fictional story) was preceded by lots of long winded foreshadowing, and followed by exhausting self praise. Every. Single. Time.As in the foreshadowing & praise was not for the content of the book as a whole, but also for every single actionable tip or advice given.I'm not even exaggerating. It was literally like for every line of wisdom, you had to deal with 4 lines of foreshadowing, 4 lines of follow up praise, and 2 more lines for continuing the annoying fictional story. Oh and 1 line of quotable quote.And okay I've to admit that the quotes were fantastic, but I did not want a book of quotes. I picked up the book for the titular content.And speaking of which, I mean sure there was some relevant content and actionable advice, but you had to navigate through a lot of crap and marketing to get to it.So much so that it felt like the author was STILL selling the book in the book. You know what I mean? And I am like, okay, you got me. I got the book. Get to point, already! But nope. And that was exhausting, to say the least.All in All: If you are looking for a way to get up early, and make the most of your mornings, there are enough free resources online (posts & videos) that you can (and probably must) turn to.Skip this book, because even though it does have some actionable tips & advice for getting up in the morning, and joining the 5 am club, wading through all the crap to get to the content is certainly not a productive use of your morning or any other time of day.Rating: 2/5.*Had this book been shorter, focusing only on the content, I would have rated it much much higher. Maybe even 4/5 stars. Because the content was good. But the fact that author made me go through a full size book to get blog post sized advice annoys me enough to give it 2/5 stars.

  Must say , it's quite a motivational read.  I am not much of a morning person but this book would motivate the reader to become one through the underlying wisdom that unfolds through the story that has very powerful impact on your thinking . It‚Äôs usually said that when you begin your day right it leads and ends right . This book resonates the same . It‚Äôs mantra is own your morning and elevate your life . It‚Äôs not only about the help to get up in the morning but how you can master that habit that eventually helps you evolve physically , mentally and spiritually.It conveys how divine and powerful the early hours of a day are and how being an early riser can improve your life on too many levels , pulling all the scattered parts of life together. The actual content of the book is silently conveyed through a little slow paced story . Definitely one of those books that worth a read to improve your ways of life.

  Just type 'motivation quotes' on Google or 'morning routine of successful people' and you will get 100 times more helpful information/insights than this brutal assault on your senses. Robin Sharma seems to be an MCP (Master of copy paste) from the University of Fake. I don't have much problem with that. Please copy paste good knowledge and put it in a concise book and sell it for a reasonable price, but no, he has to tell a story. He has to write a novel the quality of which makes Chetan Bhagat look like Shakespeare. In his self-help novel, people talk like this... ""you know as this philosopher once said this and also this author and also this celebrity and also this quote...."" and the other person nods and replies "" yeah you are right... as Brian Tracy once said this and also Zig Ziglar said that and then Aristotle also agreed and I am in a hurry as I have to take a flight in my private plane to have dinner with the Prince of Timbaktoo ..."" You will earn money later but the 10-11 hours you will need to go through this suffering, you will never get back.

  Spun in crisp and lucid language ‚ÄòThe 5 AM Club‚Äô articulates the benefits that accrue on rising early in a relatable manner. It aims at making one aware of that one extra hour that can make a career, sets the mood for an invigorating day, helps the mind plan and relax, as well as sees the individual sail on the crest of good health. Set in motion by the Spellbinder who incidentally happens to be our protagonist Mr Riley‚Äôs Guru, the lessons, the techniques and the benefits accruing of the same, are worth reading and putting into practice. While the Spellbinder sets the ball in motion, it is actually his shishya Mr. Riley who takes it forward by imparting the lessons he learnt on his way to success, to his prot√©g√©s an artist in search of fame, and an entrepreneur on the brink of losing out the business she has built over the years to unscrupulous investors. The first seven chapters see the stage being set for the final showdown that takes place from Chapter Eight onward. The upside of the background buildup is that it holds the one who loves fiction and a good story, spell-bound. It is engaging and tickles the curiosity. However the very same setting can prove a big hindrance to the one who is uninterested in fiction and has picked up the book with a purely educative interest. Why so?‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ 75 pages and that too with around 32 lines each is enough to test the patience of one who wishes to save every precious minute. The number of pages dedicated to the background setting can be unsettling for them.Dotted with infographics to help the reader better understand the techniques, the book has some wonderful insights into the life of a few legendary figures and their path to success. Replete with quotable quotes and game- changing formulas, there are a few twists too that are sure to entertain the one looking for a good story along-with life changing lessons.Well, like Robin says, '‚ÄùChange is hard at first, messy in the middle and gorgeous at the end,‚Äù so too is this book. However do note that while the beginning tends the test one‚Äôs patience, the middle offers mid blowing techniques that are not hard to put into practice. The end of course is gorgeous because you‚Äôve not only accomplished a near herculean task of covering seventeen chapters spread over 314 pages, which I‚Äôm sure is mind- boggling considering that this is a book that belongs to the Self- Help Genre, but also because the takeaway is great . Personally speaking though I loved the build-up and the twists and turns, I feel that lesser pages packed with just the right kind of information would have worked wonders for this book.In a nutshell:The book is all about discipline and the path to elevating one‚Äôs life. That one extra hour in the morning is not only the key to success, but also your pill to good health. So, ‚ÄòOwn your morning, elevate your life.‚Äô

  The story has a slow start and it takes a while for the reader to warm up to the characters. But once that is done, the reader enjoys their journey which is nothing less than motivational. Instead of putting it in a straight forward fashion, Robin Sharma weaves an engrossing tale around it with three interesting characters from different walks of life and leaves it on the reader to conclude from their life experiences. Mixing physical health with mental well being, the author shows us how this habit can actually make a huge difference in our life. Most of the ancient religious texts and naturopathy practitioners also recommend that the last meal of the day should be before 7 p.m. and of course the quote, ""Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy,wealthy and wise.""Taking a leaf from both these age old bits of wisdom, the author re-emphasizes on this very practice and how it can lead to a healthy mind, because you are well rested which in turn makes your mind think rationally after thorough analysis of every aspect.One can always argue that it is easier said than done. Added to it, the book doesn't have any practical tips per se.  However, it is still a motivation read where you can experience what difference does subtle change in habits make in your life. Written in an engaging tone, with powerful quotes by some wonderful writers at the beginning of each chapter this book is an interesting read.

  We always give chance to review the book by other than our team members. In past, we have given chance to more than 5 people and 2 of them are our core member now. So last month when one of my colleagues asked me to give him some good books, I gave him 5 AM Club by Robin Sharma only on one condition that he will provide the review for the same. Well, we both got benefited from this. Se here is the review written by my colleague Raviraj Shah.I admire the writer for attempting a new concept of sharing motivation idea in a fiction way to get readers interested in it. The author has shared a beautiful concept to develop inner power to get external achievements. It also shares how should we develop our inner power by following daily rituals. 5 AM club doesn't only share the benefits of waking up early but it shares how powerful it impacts on our rest day activities. The book helps to develop the habit of rising early and also shares what we should do after waking up. The writer has focused on the importance of phycology, emotions, physical strength and spirituality. He has shared the method of developing it and use it to achieve all our desires.The concept is beautiful the writer could have avoided fiction story or could have given less focus on it. Many times content deviated from its core point. There were places where the writer got into over-detailing which lost the main point of motivation. It also seems the material could be reduced if the writer could balance the main topic and story.I feel one should read the book at least once. If the reader find book heavy, they can avoid starting chapters and jump to later chapters to get the core idea of the book.I will give 4 out 5 stars to Robin Sharma's 5 A.M. Club.

  Firstly, I'm amazed the rating this book. People speak very highly of it. But i beg to differ....Books is tries to be reminiscent of Monk who sold his Ferrari but fails miserably.  Terribly written, with nothing to show at the end. This book could have been ended in just 5 chapters or better 5 pages. There is no take away message from this book. Nonsense charterers and situations are created throughout the book and they speak in quotes which are vaguely relatable. The book tries to hype the reader with a lame success mantra capable of realizing materialistic stuff like beach houses, cars and jets. But in the end fails horribly.  As a reader you will never feel connected and after i while it is just pain to go through the pages. Waking up at 5 A.M and planning your day is something everyone endorses and that's intuitive.I look at this book and feel frustrated and sorry for wasting time on it.I give one star as that's the lowest rating available.

  Book no doubt has a very good objective - To make people aware of getting up at 5 AM and effectively making use of your earlier mornings!But I think, the hype created around it is too high than actually its worth or stuff. Explanations like ""An assistant wearing a crisp shirt the color of the sky ..."" in such non-fictional books, I think are unnecessary and seems to a mere act of book thickening exercise! And wherever Mr. Riley goes (different countries), he has assistants helping him appearing from nowhere as if they've read his mind.I guess the book's size would get reduced by 90% if you remove such hyped up contents.

  The book goes a long way in explaining how you can change your life completely by waking up at 5 am in the morning and following the best practices given in the book to become a better person in all the areas of your life.The book explains in detail why early morning is the best time for you to invest in yourself. The best part about the book is how the author goes on to explain in detail the practices which you should follow so as to improve your life. The author explains the concepts beautifully through the story of the two lead characters and how they become the members of the 5 AM club. It is a great read if you are sure that you want to change your life and are committed to improvement at the cost of having early mornings and thus early nights. The practices explained in the book provide the best results if applied in your life , else it becomes just a self help book that you read and keep it at the back of your bookshelf.  Buy it if you are truly ready to apply these principles. All you have to do is follow the detailed explanation the author gives about how to spend the most important part of your day.

  ""The 5 AM Club"" is not a story. It has all the lessons required to succeed in our personal, family and professional lives. Robin compels us to change for better, with his signature quote, ""Change is hard at first, messy in the middle and gorgeous at the end."" He has introduced several innovative infographics to help readers understand his masterly concepts as he passionately narrates his story. There are also several cinematic twists and turns to keep the readers bound to the book. And of-course there are many of his game changing formulas. The book can easily be made into a motion picture as it follows Aaron Sorkin's 3-act structure. And now Robin has become a poet also! There are 2 - 3 beautiful poems.Here are the three most important take-home messages for me from this brand new Robin's page-turner:1. ""Life's is too short to play small with your talents.""2. ""Your excuses are seducers, your fears are liars, and your doubts are thieves.""3. ""The moment when you most feel like giving up is the instant when you must find it in you to press ahead.""

Three characters were presented and it presented a good impact on the book as it was explained in a deep way by the author.The book relates a deep understanding of the morning 5 AM Rule where how to make your life even more better as waking up early provides a different world out there. This book is for those who are or what to be a morning person because the tactics used in this book provides the entire schedule and the understanding that can be used in the morning routine.The characters who are mentioned are a billionaire, an artist and an entrepreneur who are struggling in their business lives and need to relocate their lives in the good way.

  The key idea of the book is to exploit the early mornings when your brain and body are at their peak. It is a very slow read, especially in the beginning. The non-fiction content is presented in a fictional story style. Those who enjoy fiction will surely like reading the book. There is a lot of fluff spread across the book pages. Perhaps, it is written to motivate the reader to internalize the key ideas like 20-20-20. The book could have been cut short to almost half the number of pages. But, Robin likes to show off his fictional authorship!

  Wonderful book with life lessons woven around an engaging and well crafted fictional story line. The life lessons are well articulated and presented at situations that would impress the reader to remember and follow. Read complete book in 6 days and while reading was eager to know what information would be in the next chapter. I have been following Robin Sharma from past 6 years and was happy to see all his lessons in well compiled book. Robin Sharma refresher book with high impact. A must read to of Robin Sharma followers to get all his thoughts in one place.

  This book talks about rich entrepreneurs.  As an average middle man,  you have to struggle to make ends meet.This book doesn't explain any real time practical scenarios for a common man.Waking up early is an age old practice.  Nowadays people have been caged by technology.There are many benefits of sleep early and wake up early.  But again this cannot be applied to everyone.  Night shift workers can find this suitable.

  The book came at a time when I was looking for ways to wake up early and do something in the morning that can help me to do better in my life. I would wake up post 9 in the morning and would jumbled how to spend time before reading this book.I personally admire Robin Sharma for extraordinary works he has been doing for years. However, as far as I am reviewing his book for my readers I want to remain truthful without having any influence with the impactful work Robin does. The book has many parts that you can skip especially the beginning parts. The real takeaways, tips and tricks start from chapter seven. However, I will not ask you to skip the first six chapters entirely but read it as quickly as possible.I would forcefully recommend you to read this book if you really want to achieve your goals effectively and successfully.

  The writing style of the book is strange. The way this book is written makes it uninteresting and it really fails to deliver the message (whatever that may be). It has alot of unnecessary content and it feels like the author is simply trying to fill the pages so he goes on rambling.The romantic angle in the book is simply crimgeworthy.The only good thing about this book is the print quality.

  The book is bad. It's badly written. The plot / narrative sucks. And I can't belive a publisher let Robin go ahead with this book without making major edits. I also can't believe that this is the same guy who wrote The Monk Who Sold his Ferrari. There is nothing major you can get out of this book. And you got to believe me, because I have it the benefit of doubt and went ahead fully believing in it. And came out fully disappointed.

  This is my magical book. Because it has tremendous power to transform me as what I want. üôåThank you @robinsharma for bringing this marvelous factors amongst us through your thoroughly thoughtful book. .5 points from The 5 AM Club.üìô.üìñ Excuses are seducer, fears are liars and doubts are thieves. This is directly noted from book. You have to remind this every time when you think this way. Currently I would like to pick up this line also as country is going through great turmoil so we need to accept this- ""All change is hard  at first, messy in the middle and gorgeous at the end."".üìñ Expression of greatness- When I go through this chapter I have learnt ""The 3 step success formula"". It talks from granularity level to superficiality..üìñ Inspiration from great personalities really works. So many great authors/artist have revealed through their deeds. Like- Tolstoy, Picasso. Both are history makers. üôå.üìñ The most phenomenal activities to keep your whole body in great sync demands ""The 4 interior empires"". (Mindset, Heartset, Healthset and Soulset.) I truly dwell so much under these topics and it has blown out my mind as I am currently implementing all these. It's raw and must practical. I don't want to exaggerate all these topics here rather I would recommend you to go through this..üìñ The Habit Installation Protocol- Talent isn't about inheritance but it's more about one's commitment, discipline, resilience and perseverance.  It talks about the scientific truths behind excellent habits. ‚Äî if you can develop a skill then why can't make it perfect to attain what you want. Attaining the inner will power..üìñ The 20/20/20 Formula- deconstruction of this formula from very beginning as the title of the book suggest 5 AM so does it starts with 5 AM. How to implement this and take the most of its advantageous regime. Essentialness of sleep as it suggests, sleep is eminent phenomenon of our daily life that builds so many biological factors for our total well being. A great schedule for entire day is must so there is also a deconstruction of pre sleep rituals. One more, 90/90/1 method has lured me like anything. This is to build a great unshakeable habit.üìö

  Having read the Monk who sold his Ferrari and other Robin Sharma books, I was excited at the prospect of reading another. When it arrived and I went on my travels to Sri Lanka, I thought it would be the best travelling companion. This poorly written, badly edited book was a real struggle to get through. Sure the message is a good one, but the ridiculous tale that is loosely woven around the points is frustrating to a point where I almost gave up.The language is abysmal, he seems to enjoy coining new phrases and words which are just atrocious and frankly unnecessary. The number of quotes from other people that appear ""on the back of a t-shirt"" or written here and there is such a lazy way of padding out a book and getting a point across. Each character seems to have the memory of an elephant and can recall huge swathes of text verbatim from this famous person or that one.Save yourself the trouble and buy ""the miracle morning"". It is by far a better book and essentially conveys the same points (but with an even better toolkit for when you go to sleep at night). Sorry Robin, you've seriously missed the mark with this one.

  As a Muslim, I have been rising before the sun for many years as I try not to miss my morning prayer. But I have been inconsistent in staying up after doing my morning prayers So, I bought this book to get some practical advice re how I can consistently stay up after the prayers. It has been very helpful and am trying to apply the learning. Still a long way to go but I really loved the book. I wonder whether Robin knows about the morning routine of the Prophet Muhammad and his companions. Lot of the things I have read hear has been covered in the practical teaching of Prophet Muhammad.

  This book transformed my life. It is packed with strategies and there is an free app you can download once you finish to support you on your journey. The descriptions for each strategy really helps you buy into them, in addition to spiritual thinking on why some things in life don‚Äôt work out.I scanned through the first few pages of the book where it goes into the story of the millionaire, spellbinder, artist and homeless person.  The early part of the book was not that interesting for me. I flicked to where it got into the teachings and that‚Äôs where the book came alive for me. I‚Äôve never underlined so much in a book!

  This is a great book by a fabulous man with great morals and values. He's a great and author. Always so enthusiastic and encouraging in everything that Robin  does. I follow him on Instagram and he never ceases to encourage and enthuse a person to remain committed to giving the best of themselves by investing in yourself. Nothing I can ever argue with. This book will not disappoint anyone who wants to know the way high achievers in personal and professional life create their own definition of success.  A great follow up to 'The Monk who sold his Ferarri' too. Love his work and his key message to maintaining a balanced and constructive life.  Read it and act on it!

  I normally avoid this kind of book but I took a chance, now I‚Äôm about halfway through and I‚Äôm not sure I can take much more. So far I have picked up two things that have some utility in the real world: demand more from myself and get up early. That‚Äôs all. Everything else has just been a stream of laughable hyperbole, an avalanche of quotes, bizarre analogies (‚Äò... water as clear as Abe Lincoln's conscience', really?) and what is quite honestly an amateurishly crafted story. The caricaturish people in this 'story' do not speak or behave remotely like genuine people and so I have zero interest in anything that happens to them. The dialogue from all the characters is so full of saccharine nonsense that it makes me wonder if the author is actually ingeniously satirising the 'self-improvement' genre but has forgotten to let everyone else in on the joke.I suspect the author has used fiction so that he can make outlandish statements in someone else's voice without having to expand on his concepts in any real depth as would be expected in a non-fiction work. If it had all the fluff removed it would make a pretty solid short pamphlet, but instead we get this bloated volume that is 99% filler. The thing is, I REALLY want to find out if there is eventually anything useful regarding a morning routine further on in the book but I feel like I‚Äôm in danger of straining my cringe muscles. Maybe if I DO start getting up at 5am each day I can drink enough coffee to help me wade through the molasses of another chapter by mid-morning.I was going to give this just one star, but I have decided to give it two out of appreciation for the fact that it has made some other mediocre books I‚Äôve bought feel like great literature.Note: I have this book in both the hardcover and audiobook versions so that I could also get through it while driving. The voice recording actually manages to make the characters even less realistic.

  I wanted to love this book, it‚Äôs an uplifting read but I found it a little challenging and frustrating at times.  RS really needs to employ a tougher editor, the prose is overly woolly and the message of the book could have been delivered with far fewer words.  I was also a little confused with the narrative voice, which was disjointed and confusing at times.  It‚Äôs a self help/improvement book written as a fable but the authors perspective and views are overtly displayed in the opinions of the ‚Äúbillionaire‚Äù, which in my opinion detracts from the story.Overall it‚Äôs a nice book and I will take away and implement some of the recommendations, but if you buy this don‚Äôt expect a well structured and robustly edited story, if RS wanted to put as much of himself in this book as he did he would have been better sticking to a simple Non Fiction style.

  I really loved this book, 5am Club by Robin Sharma. I've been waiting for a years to release his book and finally I got one last Dec2018. I truly admire his teachings and practically apply it on my routine. What I really like the most is the 20/20/20 formula. I am not use to wake at 5am or early because I want to maximize my sleep, but in his book he mentioned about the quality of sleep and how to sleep early so you can get out to bed at 5am. I am now at Day 34 on my 66 days challenge and it's now my routine to wake up at 5am, sometimes I set my alarm at 0450 so I can maximize the first 20min pocket which is Move. I do yoga on this first 20 mins and it revitalize my flexibility and it I felt energetic for the whole day. This book is awesome, my treasure. I want to read it again to capitalize the learnings from the Guru, Robin Sharma! Thanks again Robin. Can't wait to release your next Very Inspiring and Superb book!

  Definitely in two minds about this book. Robin Sharma has some great models of excellence in his toolkit, but this one didn't hang together coherently for me. Unlike 'The Monk who sold...' the story here is tortuous and contrived to make his point. The device for introducing random quotes by having them appear on artifacts throughout the book is jarring. It might work in a movie to see these things in the background, but not in a book. The fiction writing feels poor and detracts from the message - attempts to paint a scene or an image pop up to disturb the narrative, much like the doves or butterflies, and the language is stilted and painfully attempts to be trendy. I found myself longing for just one 'anyhow' rather than 'anyhoo', or for the protagonists to be referred to as 'my friends' just to avoid the grating repetition of 'cats'. We are whisked around the world to places that have obviously had an impact on Sharma's life and that he wants to share with us, but that feel as if they are forced into the story for no real purpose, even to the point that the Robben Island visit at the end feels cliched despite the obvious message. Perhaps if we hadn't bounced around the world so much earlier on it wouldn't feel like 'here we go again'. The models introduced for some reason fail to stick in the mind, sliding easily out of our memories perhaps because they are simply restating the things we already know without providing any real hooks to hang them on. I'll reread the penultimate chapter as it does seem to form a good conclusion, but I left the book wishing I had just read that chapter with a little more introduction. It felt like there were some real nuggets of wisdom in there, but wrapped up in too much novelisation to make it easy to extract them. I'll use some of the tools and the ideas to create a better early morning world for myself, but I found myself longing for something that would give me the real tools to sustain such a radical change in my mornings, the practicalities of which seemed to be skated over.I wanted to like this. But somehow it fell short. In 'The Monk Who Sold..' the story and the message were interwoven and depended on each other. Here it felt like an artificial device and maybe this time the use of fiction actually detracts from the message rather than supporting it, causing me to have to work hard to separate the message from the storyline, and finding myself wincing when the two collided, as they seemed to do far too often. There's a romance in there. A life threatening illness. An extra violent business takeover threat. None of them advance the theme of the book one iota. There's good stuff here, but you're going to have to work hard to find it.

  A craftsman records the world as it is. An artist shapes it as he sees it. Robin Sharma is an artist who envisions a new world filled with purposeful competence. And it is not an impossible one to attain. He writes: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a ton of competition at ordinary, but there‚Äôs almost none at extraordinary.‚Äù Imagine using this in terms of job-hunting and workplace growth. This is just one of many nuggets of good information that takes the reader deep into a journey of self-discovery. The 5 AM Club is the perfect wake-up call to action.  Richard

  I thought this was a nonfiction book with some practical advice about getting up early and hopefully moreIt is not...I honestly only read about 10% of the book. It is a weird story of some entrepreneur at rock bottom attending a tony robbins like event.Besides that it was not what i expected, it is really terribly written. It is boring, the characters are extremely stereotypical and at least the part i read was lacking any surprise or knowledge or anything fascinating.After the 10% I flipped through the rest and it seems to continue like that.It is really just a boring story with no value at all.If you interested into early rising and morning productivity get Hal Elrods Miracle Morning.

  It is Robin Sharma's style to convey information and his life advice through an extended parable.To start with the positive: the guidance the 5AM club conveys inherently good ideas for living a better life. By following its precepts (difficult) I have no doubt all readers will lead a more fulfilling time on earth.However, Mr Sharma is an poor writer without the assistance of a good editor. I get the impression that the expense of an experienced editor was not employed for this book whereas it has on others. The use of language and metaphor is, I am disappointed to say, at times cringeworthy. It really comes down to dialogue and characterisation - the 4 protagonists and in particular the 3 main ones - the Billionaire, the Entrepreneur and the Artist - speak in a stilted, over-elaborate and unrealistic manner. Even accepting that this is a parable and so should be judged by different standards than a novel, the florid language and excess verbiage needed to be toned down or adjusted to real patterns of speech. A good part of the book reads as if written by an enthusiastic 17 year old who has been asked to weave the excellent underlying ideas into a story, guided by some plot ideas from her 12 year old brother.I repeat that the book's underlying themes are valuable, are uplifting and the quotations written on T-shirts, caps etc do contain the wisdom of the ages.So I can just about recommend, but be warned. I was able to read to the end and enjoy despite being regularly irritated by claptrap in the dialogue, but if you do not like poor writing style, you won't get very far.

  I got to know Robin Sharma through his YouTube videos and i have to stay I really liked his videos. So when I got his email about his new book, I got excited to pre-order it hoping I will learn more about owning my morning and change my life. I got disappointed just after reading the first few chapters and I didn't find the patience or the motivation to finish it.The only way I can describe this book by saying it is novel written by a bad story teller. I should have waited to read the first reviews before buying it. So, it is a total waste for money . For now, I should just stick with his free videos on YouTube.

  I‚Äôm not sure what I was expecting, but this wan‚Äôt it.

Ironically I started reading this as part of the ‚Äúread‚Äù part of the miracle morning practice!I kept waiting for it to get better, I bought the book because samples rarely give me a complete experience to be able to judge a book and, I admit, I was swept along by the reviews and the big promises about maximising my entire existence just by getting up an hour earlier.Have I tried anything from the book? Nope. I already get up early and I already spend the morning armouring myself for the day ahead. I am also 45% through the book and have yet to find anything actually actionable, other than get up at 5. There‚Äôs an awful lot of story from not a single likeable character, though. Like, a LOT of empty words ...Own your morning elevate your life is the tag line for this book and I agree, that is true, but please believe me when I say that if you can make it through this whole book you don‚Äôt need it because you already have a superhuman pain tolerance and enough grit to salt the roads of the UK for 40+ years

  There may be good content in here, but it's hard to find. I couldn't finish it, despite trying pretty hard - I don't like giving up. Any halfway decent editor could have knocked this into shape, but the author is so full of himself he thinks he doesn't need one. It's cliche upon cliche - everything is 'vast' or 'massive'. To be fair, sometimes the text is more unpredictable. 'One could see he was a man of towering depths.' Say what? Sharma's never heard of 'show not tell' - 'you would have enjoyed being there, at that fabulous moment.' It's like Dan Brown on an off day. Buy it if you want to, but the part I did read suggests you get up early and work hard without distractions. Exercise regularly and drink plenty of water.Here and there it's downright offensive. 'Poverty is the consequence of an inner condition, not an outer situation.' Tell that to the starving kids in the Yemen.

  I just want to start by saying I make a point of finishing every book I start, even if I'm not enjoying it. That being said, this book takes the not so proud mantle of being a rare book I just couldn't finish. There are clearly hugely valuable lessons in the book that we can apply to life, but they are all diluted by a hugely excessive back story. It becomes harder and harder to read, and almost comical how the characters seemingly have 6 million lengthy quotes from philosophers embedded in their brain, which they can recite word for word. I would say: get up early, work harder, focus your mind, get the most out of the day. Saved you the utter wishy-washy turmoil of reading this.

The beauty of this book and its teachings is you can take as much or as little as you want to put into practice. My advice would be to start small and build on the habits. That way you won't quit before you see results. Its also worth reading Robins other books particularly ""The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari "".

  I'm halfway through this and so far, it feels like 5% amazing guidance/advice and 95% fluff (or at most 10/90) Great advice, but after the first 5 chapters or so, I just had to go to a skim/scan approach - just too long-winded and repetitive.  BUT - there's some really wonderful and inspiring guidance in there, if you don't mind having to wade thru the mediocre story-telling in between.UPDATE: Just finished it. Wow. Writing that is often so bad that I laughed out loud; fiction is NOT Mr Sharma's gift and hard to understand how his editor would allow this to be published in it's current form. Forced dialogue, shallow characters, overall clumsy storytelling. (And I just read another reviewer say it's the best book he's ever read !??!!!???  He must be fairly new to reading, or otherwise have not been exposed to any skillful storytelling.)And yet - there are some lovely, powerful ideas here. Nothing new - all of this familiar and timeless advice is available many other places -  but a decent compendium of useful guidance and tips on achievement, habit development, life in general and a variety of personal growth/development ideas. This would have been a GREAT and really useful 20 page eBook guide if stripped of the shallow, repetitive, awkward storytelling.So I guess I'll stick with my 3 star review, tho if there was a 2.5 option available, I'd have chosen that.PS: Recently finished James Clear's ""Atomic Habits"" - excellent. The scope of that book is narrower than this book, but TERRIFIC habit formation and related advice.

  This book is a must-have. For anyone looking to bulletproof their discipline, and upgrade their personal and professional lives in a big way, this book is a necessary read. Written in story format, Robin Sharma encourages people to wake up before dawn and calibrate four interior empires - Mindset, Heartset, Healthset and Soulset, in order to fundamentally lift the quality of your days, weeks, months, years and ultimately your life.

  I am big fan of Robin Sharma and pre-ordered this book because I felt it is great idea to wake up early and with Robin sharma providing tools and techniques to accomplish more, it would be a great buy. While the book does have tools and techniques they are just few and the 3 main characters never connect to you at any level occasionally feeling like forced writing by the author. I wish the book was crisp, richer in content and characters highly compelling. The advt also offered me to give free membership in 5 am club so i can practice but once i purchased the book , i do not find the link anywhereThanks

  The advice is just OK: Wake up at 5AM, exercise, meditate, etc.. Though there is NO‚Äîas in zero‚Äîevidence that people who rise early are more fulfilied, contented, prosperous then people who do not. But what makes this book a complete tragedy is the disasterous storytelling Sharma tries to knit his advice into. I am no literary critique but even I found myself literally laughing out loud and/or scoffing audibly at his storyline. This is the self-help literary equivilant of 50 Shades of Grey. To put a finer point on it, Sharma also fails with his silly, unintuitive, unmemorable accronyms littered about, that will confuse more than clarify. I've walked through puddles with more depth than the characters such as 'the Billionaire with chissled abs' or 'the artist who desired to produce great art'. My gawd what a terrible book. And frankly, even the advice is like an overgrown garden full of weeds and wild plants. You'll have to dig and dig to find something that has any longterm use beyond: Meditate, exercise, and be grateful. Truly, the worst book‚Äîof any kind‚ÄîI have ever forced myself to finish reading.

  This was, for me, an impossibly long-winded, and totally improbable, account of someone who promises the earth to two strangers telling them that they just have to follow a whole series of intricate, involved, and ever more bizarre (mostly) early morning activities. The main protagonist, ends up flying these strangers to his private island, and other countries, where the 'secrets' of success are gradually revealed. Despite insisting that these activities will bring untold, limitless wealth, and practically everlasting health along with them, the main protagonist himself dies by the end. I found this utterly preposterous and sincerely regretted spending my precious time on this 'story.'

  As we read the book it's clear how much care and effort Robin Sharma put into this work for creating a curious and entertaining story that delivers a VERY powerful and practical framework that anyone can adapt to their personal circumstances for driving transformation at multiple levels. This is not a superficial self-help book and I found this to be the encouragement I needed to reignite certain priorities. I do recommend the reading. the companion mobile app and wish you a great transformation.

  I like the language Robin Sharma uses - so many books these days don't experiment with language or everything is written to a lower level.  Yes the story is a little disjointed and for some this might be disturbing, but then this is not a novel. It is a book that introduces another perspective on how to make the best of your life - or what you have left of it.I for one, was never an early bird - However, I chose to start rising at 5am a few days before New Year and although hard in the beginning, I find I get a lot more done in the day and have much more energy.  I am looking forward to 'messy in the middle' because now I want to experience 'gorgeous at the end' :)Is the book worth getting?  If you are open minded and willing to stretch towards doing something better with your life than you are presently doing - then most definitely. Get it, read it and put as much as you can into practice.  There is nothing worse than regretting something not done.

  If you have read everything and seen everything that Robin Sharma has written or produced before, you might not read something new in the book. But in this book everything is being connected to each other. Helping you to create a morning routine that can last. In the past I've tried to start this morning routine, by following bits and pieces of the advice that is in this book. But now, since reading it, it is finally a routine that is sticking. Because of all the great models, and the compelling story; in other words this book changed my life already.

  Robin Sharma has a way with words. It's an interesting self-help book based on the premise that waking up early will bring much success to your life.Quick Synopsis:It is told in the perspective of 2 characters that come from two different walks of life, after meeting a billionaire CEO at a convention that becomes their mentor and guides them on a journey to improve their life. It's a bit different from your typical self-help book. This is more so based on a fictional setting and story which makes it unique and might confuse you a bit at first. It's quite different in that sense.Criticism: My problem is that it is way too repetitive and feels dragged out with some fancy words, graphs, and theories, when in reality it's just the same premise: wake up early so you can get more things done. Nevertheless, i'm grateful for the knowledge and wisdom from this book, but it could honestly be cut in half.

  What I liked best about this book was that it had all of Robin Sharma‚Äôs teachings about getting up early to craft a beautiful life in the one book. It‚Äôs full of practical tips and techniques to install the habit of getting up at 5am and applying to 20/20/20 formula to move, reflect and grow from 5 to 6 am. Things like intense exercise, journaling, gratitude practice, meditation, review goals and reading/learning.  I love how the ideas presented are backed by Science. I also love how I can customise the key ideas to make it my own. I started practicing the techniques on the 1st of January and it has definitely been a game changer for me. 17 days into it and I‚Äôm still very focused and on fire to start my days with exercise, reflection and reading (reading both to learn and for pleasure). It‚Äôs the best way to start the day, when the rest of the world (and my family) are asleep.

  Honestly did not want this book to end! I thoroughly enjoyed reading it from start to finish - with a TON of valuable life lessons written beautifully into an entertaining and easy to read story. This book was inspiring from start to finish and left me highly motivated to take new actions daily in my life, right away. I would even love to read it again - simply to highlight phrases, lessons, quotes, insights and take more notes!It is such a gem - I'm incredibly grateful to Robin Sharma for writing this book!

  This book had me actually laughing out loud at the ridiculous dialogue and storytelling. Bits and pieces of Sharma's ideas surface every now and then, in a way that tries to string the reader along to find them. Almost as if the writer knew that they had to hide the information in all the fluff to get a person to read this book through.Sometimes, fluff is okay in a story. Not this fluff, however. It is directed at the lowest common denominator. The dialogue reads like something out of an infomercial script and the repetition is painful. The story contributes absolutely nothing to the presentation of the 5am method.What bugs me most about this book is that the validity of the 5am method in this story is ""proven"" to the reader via a fictional narrative. The embodiment of the method, the so called ""billionaire (as he is reffered to during the entire story, bleh!),"" does not exist. The writer creates a fantasy of a perfect human being to prove the method. It doesn't make sense. In the book, the billionaire teacher is one of the world's most successful businessmen, is ultra-fit, possesses unimaginable wealth & power, has incredible charisma and is adored by everybody. In no uncertain terms, the book states that anybody who follows the method can be like him. Except, he doesn't follow any method, because he is not real.Please do yourself a favour and just google the method and it's related diagrams and flow-charts. There is definitely validity to the ideas, it's just so completely unnecessary to slog through the awful story and dialogue.

  I really enjoyed reading this book because it is well catered to people who are focused on a self help ideal and a well structured method to protect some hours of the day to help the reader set aside some time for exercise, self-renewal and personal growth.

  Ich bin begeistert. Im Vergleich zu anderen ""Selbsthilfe"" B√ºchern ist dieses in Form einer Geschichte geschrieben. Gut die ist manchmal was kitschig und √ºbertrieben, aber sehr gut zu folgen und sogar spannend. Es wird ausf√ºhrlich erkl√§rt was fr√ºh aufstehen bringt und was man morgen machen kann um gut in den Tag zu starten. Dazu gibt es noch verschiedene Konzepte um die Produktivit√§t √ºber den Tag aufrecht zu erhalten. Klingt erstmal nach Strapazen, macht am Ende aber vieles leichter, wenn man essenzielle Dinge wie Sport, Planen und Lesen schon morgens erledigt hat.

  Unfortunately I was disappointed by Robin's book. So expectancy about it. But it's not AT ALL, a mindset or motivating book like others in this field. It's literally a NOVEL with some graph or I should say pictures of advice or follow rules guidance. I don't understand why is editor hasn't seen the potential of the content and guide Robin to write it with positive mindset setup. If I wanted to read a Novel, I would have bought a Novel. Don't be fooled by the cover and backcover. It's not at all what's inside or I should say the way people would expect from a self development book. Deeply Sorry for this review.

  Following the guidelines in this book has been nothing short of amazing, life changing even...and I‚Äôm not even finished. Previously a night owl, I realised that I only stayed up late because I hadn‚Äôt had any quality ‚Äòme‚Äô time and the sooner I went to bed the sooner my rat on a wheel existence would start again....but I was too tired to do anything productive or fulfilling in the evenings so staying up was just wasted time. Now I love my evening wind down and go to bed earlier knowing that when I wake up I get to experience the highlight of my day. I‚Äôm really achieving some personal goals and life feels more balanced.Down side of the book is the storyline vehicle the author chose to deliver the message. I found it cringe worthy and have had to muscle through all the doves, rainbows and superficial characters because I like the learnings...maybe I‚Äôll find at the end of the book there‚Äôs a point to them being there...the jury is out. I‚Äôm sure other people may have enjoyed the quirkiness.All in all valuable lessons to be learned.

  Horrible book with zero practical advice. One of the most misleading titles ever. Pseudo intellectual self-help story of a group of people bonding at a guru‚Äôs event. First book I ever returned in my life. Not sure what these 5 star reviewers smoked.

  I will just start off by saying this is quite possibly the best book I have read and I am an avid book reader. I would give it 10 stars if I could. In addition to the life lessons that I took away from this book, the story was incredible.  I was waiting for this book since I pre ordered it and in no way did it disappoint and it even exceeded my exceptions. I haven‚Äôt read all of Robin‚Äôs other work but what I have read is The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari and the Secret Letter‚Äôs of the Monk Who Sold His Ferrari, both amazing books and would highly recommend those as well. I am very excited to start implementing Robin‚Äôs teachings in this book to transform my life. In addition to the book, you also have access to an app that will help you on the journey to mastery that is offered for FREE. It is a no brainer to purchase this book if you are serious about taking control of your life. It might be hard at first to implement change but as Robin pointed out, all the legends and heroes and icons of society went through some type of suffering to get to where they are. There is so many more lessons you will get from this book I promise you that if you study it. I can‚Äôt wait to pay this book forward to anyone I can

  What amazes me most is the severe negative reviews by some.  I can only assume they were hoping to buy a book that actually gave them a SIMPLE solution to build a better life.  It's mind blowing when you read some of them.  It's very clear that either they can't read, or didn't read much of the book.  But I go back to the fact that like many....They are looking for an easy way to build an epic life.  And for those of you hoping that just getting up at 5 a.m. will transform your life???  It's better than wasting away like many do getting up at 7,8,9 or 10......But.....NO, the act of getting up at 5 a.m. or early will be a step in the right direction but it's only the start.For those that have ever read or listened to Robin you will find just about EVERY principle he has ever taught in this book.  You will also find WHY those principles WORK.  There is a reason Robin is not only living an Epic Life, but has helped lead many to that life.  It starts with WORK.... Yes you have to Work.  But it's also important to understand the physiology, psychology, and neurology by those that are at the cutting edge in these areas.  YES that stuff is in this book.  It's also vital to understand, as Robin mentions in the book it takes 66 days to form habits.  By the fact the book has only been out a couple of weeks, apparently the results for the negative reviewers after a few days of implementation wasn't enough to transform their lives.  I am laughing as I type this (hahahaha).  I guess reading Arnolds book on Body Building better give me the results I've always wanted after a week or NEGATIVE reviews for his book will be spewed by day 8.  I am only focusing on the negative reviewers because it's a joke the way they have analyzed The 5 a.m. Club.I will simply close with the advice I give my patients and those I coach in the real world.  Do the work and SEE if it works!!! It's as simple as that.  The knowledge  and tools are all in this book.  The effort to follow Robin's guidance will be MONUMENTAL if you do it.  It won't be easy but it will transform your life.  Don't believe me.  Do it for 66 days then write your review.

  The 5 AM Club is, much like all of Sharma‚Äôs work, a book for anyone looking to breakthrough to the next level. Here‚Äôs what I love about Robin Sharma, much like Patrick Lencioni and Paulo Coelho, he uses a fable style to deliver incredible content in a way anyone can consume and enjoy. As a business owner and leader, he offers a different way to learn leadership lessons, hundreds of quotes and takeaways, and language that is compelling and different. The genius exists in telling a story about a powerful orator instead of personally taking ownership of the material himself. The entrepreneur, the artist, and the homeless man in the book go on an adventure that is closer to reality than fiction. Richard Branson and many other billionaires of our time create moments and opportunities like this for people in their lives and vulnerability, authenticity, and a little luck can create these opportunities for others. In 2013, a client in our clothing store created a moment for my wife and I that changed the course of our lives and it started from a brief conversation and simply asking a question.In 2014, I read the Monk Who Sold His Ferrari. I was an attorney who had finished law school and knew I wanted to pursue something different and I did not know what. The book helped me commit to the career path I chose, in real estate (not becoming a monk), and as wild as it sounds, like the Alchemist by Coelho, instilled hope and adventure back into my imagination. My wife read The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari in one sitting at a time where she was looking to find a path and focus. Then we read The Leader Who Had No Title and in 2015 I lost 55 pounds, took on another vertical position of growth in my company, and committed to getting up at 4:30 AM each morning to run, read, and journal. Robin‚Äôs books and his material have driven my wife and I to take the risks and challenge ourselves the way we have. Was it just Robin‚Äôs content? No, and yet his books, podcasts, and YouTube videos stick out as watershed experiences on a path to creating our life by design. So much so, that I have borrowed the phrase ‚Äúwith love and respect‚Äù from Robin more than a few times. Business books and leadership content could all be the same and it would be boring. A step by step how to wake up at 5 AM and live your life would have been useful and very short. The truth is, like Jim Rohn said, ‚Äúwhen enough is enough meets massive action your life will change‚Äù. The 5 AM Club tells a story that you need to see, hear, and experience. Just surrender to how wild, crazy, and silly it can be at times to think events like this could occur because when you do allow yourself to imagine that this could be you, one day it will be. Potential mentors, gurus, and masters in your life are more available than you know and when the student is ready they will appear. Robin Sharma outlines the value of getting up at 5 AM, the value of being open to opportunity and adventure, and the value of vulnerability and connection with others. The book is laced with countless business, leadership, and life lessons. It may be the most quotable piece of material from Robin yet and that is saying a lot. This is a great book, and like all of Robin‚Äôs content, a must for anyone looking to breakthrough to another level.

  Still reading this book slowly and understand some of reviews given to this novelThis is not meant to be an opus to Robin Sharma ability to write novels but more as a conduit to deliver accumulated knowledge to help people find the best of themselvesI love the book so far and am reading and listening to the audiobookThere are so many pearls of information that it is a great book that can be read over a lifetime if need beSome books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested: that is, some books are to be read only in parts, others to be read, but not curiously, and some few to be read wholly, and with diligence and attention. ~ Francis BaconThis is believe us the  latter for this bookFirst updateStill reading the book slowly after listening to the audiobook ... can‚Äôt stress enough the importance of reading and reflecting on his work and informationNot a novel but something else is in Mr. Sharma style that will be recognized as a great piece of literature especially for those wanting self improvement and progress on their journeySecond updateFinished audiobook and still reading the book to reinforce the ideas as well as started the 66 day appMight be wishful thinking but can see changes in my days for the betterContinuing updateNearing the end of the book and my original thoughts are still accurateNot a great writer in the sense of novelist but if you want to read a book that will give you a chance to change your life ...

  I couldn't get through 100 pages in this book because it's so bad. The content is delivered through a story of people looking to make radical changes to their lives, the only problem is that it's not relatable, poorly written, and complete derails for the message of this book. I watched a YouTube review of this book to get the basic principles of this book:1. You need to push yourself outside of your comfort zone2. You need to wake up an hour earlier and dedicate that time to your growth3. You should split up your ""extra"" morning hour to 3 20 minute chunks where you move/sweat, learn, and reflect

  I received Robin's email announcing the release of his book ""The 5AM Club"" .  It immediately triggered a memory for me of a time when my daily routine consisted of rising at 5am and being at the gym by 5:30.  I was amazed at how quickly those feelings came back to me; as I had been trying to get back to the gym for some time....to no avail.I ordered the book, hoping to receive it within a few days of being released.  While waiting, I started going back to the gym.  I finally received the book a few weeks later, as the demand was so great.  I started reading the book and couldn't put it down.  I finished it within 3 days and then downloaded the App.  He told the story in a way that was Inspiring and Motivating while moving the Human Spirit. I also had many AH HA Moments.....as if he was talking to me!  He included many Tools that you will want to go back and revisit  until they become ingrained within.  After finishing the book and participating in the online group within the App; I've now went back and started rereading the book.  I've also told other people about the book and recommended it to them.One thing I'd like to mention to anyone reading reviews about this book.  After ordering and having to wait; I read many of the online reviews on Amazon.  While I'm familiar with Robin's work, I've never read any of his books.  I couldn't believe the abundance of  bad reviews I was seeing.  So much so; that I considered cancelling my order.  I'M SO GLAD I DIDN'T!  I would have missed out on one of the best books I've ever read.  I now plan on exploring Robin's many other books.

  Words cannot express how awful the writing in this book is. Self-indulgent, overwritten, cartoonish, and really just too terrible to bear. It may be full of great advice, I‚Äôll never know because I just couldn‚Äôt read it. It hurt my brain. I did notice as I skimmed through pages looking for substance that there‚Äôs a lot of talk about being excellent or amazing or whatever.  Every single page in this book proves that the author has not taken the time to learn a single thing about good writing, never mind attempt any kind of mastery, leaving me to conclude that he‚Äôs a giant fraud.

  The most useful information is in the last few chapters of the book.  The story felt contrived and made me roll my eyes at times.  It felt like the storyline just prolonged the time to get to the useful information which probably could have been put into 10-20 pages.  Summary: wake up an hour early to do 20 minutes of exercise, 20 minutes of journaling/meditation, and 20 minutes of building your mind (reading a book, practicing a skill, etc).  Do for 66 days to build the habit.  There were some one lines that were insightful but overall I felt that a book that could have been 10-20 pages long was stretched to make it an actual book.

  I‚Äôve always loved Robin Sharma‚Äôs approach to teaching. The narrative stories he creates to share his wisdom is so accessible and enjoyable to read. I‚Äôve been an off again and on again early riser for years, but I could never make it stick. While I‚Äôve only started implementing the frameworks of the 5am Club, I can already see that this new approach will have much more staying power for me.I was also surprised and thrilled to discover that this book was about so much more than just rising early and how to do it. It‚Äôs a book filled with wisdom to help you rise to mastery and serve the world in all areas of your life, at all times of the day.

  Over the course of my life I‚Äôve always thought that rising early possessed some sort of Magical Powers - while I‚Äôve never consistently done it, I have experienced some great benefits whenever I did and for that reason I anxiously waited for this book to be published.I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm totally pleased or extremely disappointed...but what I will say is there is great value in the ides and principles given to us by Mr Sharma.Don‚Äôt expect amazing story telling because Mr Sharma somehow fell short in that area however expect Mr Sharma to provide you with great content and usable principles in a fun way. Yes, there are times you may feel like you  have to go through a bit of information to get to the meat and potatoes but reading this book is worth the time and could change your life.I believe the content provided was presented in a fun way, easy to read, usable, can be easily implemented and will be beneficial if implemented.This is the book I choose to be my companion for 2019 and I am looking forward to using the life/business principles and ideas. I have read this book three times, listened to the audio twice, I have recommended it to my friends & family and have purchased a few for some of my employees.I would recommend you buy this book if you‚Äôre looking for ideas that will WORK and greatly benefit you. I suggest you read the book, reflect on the ideas presented, make notes and re-read as many times as you can.I would have given the book 4.5 stars if that was an option, instead I gave it 5 stars because of the invaluable content.

  Half way through the book, and every bit is amazing. To the reviews that is saying they had to skim read, i would say they do not get the whole point of being personnel best. Robin Sharma through out the book is trying to tell to be exceptional which very few are and to be exceptional, u need to work hard. If your view point is easy attitude than this book is not for you. All change is hard at first, messy in the middle and gorgeous in the end- u need to get this concept while you read this book, which is why u may find some dialogues are being repeated - but that is for a purpose.

However, this book is a bit of a cumbersome read.The fictional story-telling to try to make a point is just plain clunky and distracting.

  Yet another masterpiece by Robin Sharma that captures so well all of his teaching over the years. Robin's ability to bring important lessons to the reader via a tale that captures the audience's attention never ceases to amaze me. He masterfully takes us on a world tour of all of his own favorite places giving us not only an insight into how to improve our lives, but also how we can enjoy the beauty that the world around us bestows upon us, yet we often lack the focus to see.I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to improve the life they live and wants to leave a true and giving legacy. To those who lack the focus in their everyday life, this book teaches you how to drive away procrastination and harness your willpower.Waking up at 5 am has truly made a difference in my life and I am proud to be one of the newer members of the #5amClub - a remarkable approach to getting the most out of my life. I encourage you all to read this book and apply its principles - they truly impact the quality and enjoyment of your life.Thank you Robin for all the hard work you put into this book - it is one that truly inspires people and further builds upon the amazing legacy you are leaving your readers.

  Where to even start?I bought this book after listening to a podcast interview with Robin, and my interest in this book was certainly piqued. So I bought it.I didn't know what to expect; I assumed it was just going to be a typical self-help book. But the author decided to attempt a narrative self-help book similar to how The Richest Man in Babylon (a very well-written and captivating self-help novella) is written. To say Robin Sharma fell short would be to give him more credit than he deserves.Let's just make a short list of the issues here:There is zero character development.The dialogue is heavy-handed and contrived beyond belief.The interactions between characters is unnatural to the point of comicality.The forced quotes and insights are cringe-worthy.There is absolutely no natural flow.It's abundantly clear that Robin did absolutely no research on how to write a good story. Simply put, it was actually painful to read.I mean just the whole thing ‚Äî I can't wrap my head around how this was ever allowed out of an editor's office. Robin should go back to writing pure non-fiction, and the editor of this particular book should be banned from the literary world.

  This book inspired me to take up a morning routine again. Awhile back I read and practiced Hal Elrod's Miracle Morning routine, stuck with it for a few months but eventually fell off the wagon.On my 3rd day after reading it I finally managed to get up at 5:00. I now wake up at 4:50 ever since (avg 6 days out of 7) and go for a 15-20 minute run at 5:00 AM sharp. The worse the weather outside, the more I enjoy it. When I get back, I write down my plans for the day, I journal, and meditate. I pretty much do it all by the book. I read until 6:00 or 6:15. When I'm done reading I proceed to complete whatever I planned for the day.The fascinating thing is that I have so much energy and I get a ton of amazing stuff done during the day. I've read the book twice now and it's definitely started a snowball effect in my personal and business growth.I would give it 5 stars if the dialogue in the book sounded more realistic, more the way real people talk. Perhaps I'm being unjust by knocking off a star just for that reason, especially when the book changed my life, but hey, that's how I feel at the moment. The wisdom in the book is great though.

  I have mixed feelings about Robin Sharma's demeanor (I first discovered him during an interview on Impact Theory) but the book title really interested me since it advocates for building a routine in the morning. He won me over half way whenever he would quote proper scientific reason for his approach. But the fiction mixed with fact, although making it a lighter read, was also a bit of a turn off for my taste. Still.. there are interesting lessons to be learned. I won't deny that. But they could have been told more succinctly and efficiently. I believe this was the author's attempt to make the lecture more dynamic and pleasant, involving characters and emotion with his point or view. Some aspects of the book are totally cheesey and way more dream like for my taste. Somewhere along the line there's that thing where he's trying to offer some emotional answers to fundamental questions and wonderings of life via some romanticized speculations. I'm way too hard wired into scientific thought patterns to enjoy wishy washy stuff. Additionally I feel some things are repeated too much or over elaborated. I agree with about half of his ideas and suggestions to give a rough estimate and feel that I have learned a little something from finishing this read. I feel he is a better spokesman than writer. I've yet to read or see more about him and his work to get a bigger and clearer picture of him and his performances but so far I've not been extraordinarily impressed although I've found it to be a moderately useful read.

  The author makes grandiose and fantastical claims about how to ‚Äúelevate‚Äù your life without ONCE citing any research. Very disappointing. I bought this book after listening to a podcast on MindValley. The podcast was much more valuable, but definitely a sales pitch, which I could tell going into it but was so compelled by the key take aways that I went ahead and bought the book (very out of character).As others are saying it is written like a horrible nonfiction novel. I think for anyone who is a literary person this book would be painful to read. The take aways are there, but heavily veiled with NO RESEARCH.Basically, devote the first hour of your day to self-growth. 20 minutes physical exercise, 20 minutes self-reflection/meditation (spiritual exercise), and 20 minutes of learning (mental exercise). Nothing he is suggesting is radical. Plenty of other motivational gurus and life coaches will tell you that how you start your day sets the stage for how it goes‚Äî from intention (‚ÄúI will have a good day today‚Äù) to organization (making your bed first thing).Other things he suggests you have probably heard before too‚Äî work in hour long sprints with ten minute breaks.

  The 5 am club is an excellent read. I enjoyed the storyline Robin builds in while teaching his approach to the reader. It helped me to conceptualize it and also to predict what my experience may be like when I started, such as the challenging points. I think when starting any new habit, preparation and planning has to occur first. Reading The 5 am club helped me prepare to start my own 5 am club! I appreciated the neuroscience behind the 20/20/20 theory and how brain chemicals such as, Dopamine play such a huge role in motivation. Robin does an excellent job of framing the science with his approach, which gave it much credibility from my point of view. I have been engaging in this approach for 9 days now and see amazing results already. Getting up early is getting easier the longer I do so, I feel much calmer in the mornings, less irritable, more patient and focused throughout the day. In addition, my 20 minute work outs have already increased my fitness a great deal. I am a fan!

The story is boring, the characters are cringeworthy, and he just doesnt ever seem to say much. It's a book about optimizing your time and efforts, yet is a total waste of time to read... the idea of getting up early to start your day off right is not a novel idea and he just didnt have anything else to add to it so he found a way to fill hundreds of pages to say what could have been said in 30 max.

  The title is so misleading. I boought the book thinking I was going to get a direct plan, a direct set of ideas. Instead we get a science ficion book.

Another things. The book is an irrelevent boring science fiction book!! It is a waste of valuable time. I spent HOURS reading this book, when I couldve easily just seen a 10 min video and gotten the same ideas and objectives as in to reading a science fiction book. Last note, theres many many parts in the book(A WASTE OF MY TIME) where the characters are described, for example "" The entreprenur had a nylon duffle bag over her shoulders. She styled a silk blouse with bohemian sleeves, designer blue jeans......."" who cares what the characters are wearing who cares what they are doing? ALL I WANT IS A PLAN, AN OBJECTIVE, NOT DESCRIPTIONS OF IMAGINERY CHARACTERS THAT HAVE A HORRIBLE PERSONALITY. They are all damaged. She grew up without a dad, shes dated multiply men.

Fiction is not Mr. Sharma‚Äôs talent, but there are powerful ideas in this book, tips on achievement, habit development and beautiful and powerful quotes, which I believe anyone will enjoy in whatever stage in life or business you are.Stripped off the rather shallow and unnecessary storytelling and forced dialog, this could be a great book .It is no surprise that most great leaders and successful entrepreneurs rise early, there are about a million reasons to do so, but one reason in particular that made the most sense to me was;The mind gets tired as the day progresses‚Ä¶and it‚Äôs only logical that your ability to create great above mediocre outcome will diminish. If you want to rise above average and create great success, rising early is not questionable and you have no excuse not to do so. In fact, I believe it will be something you will regret for the rest of your life if you do not practice this habit to try to take advantage of this beautiful life you were given.So, to sum up, get up early, invest into growth during that first hour, whether that is 5, 6 or 7 am, then set little milestones for the day, reflect & exercise‚Ä¶BUT, do it consistently and at a minimum of 66 days to make it routine. Those are my takeaways, along with a few beautiful quotes. All in all, I recommend giving it a read.

  I really wanted to love this book and find the meaning in it that my friend did when she recommended it to me. But I cannot get past the fictional storytelling format.

  I'm a big Robin Sharma fan.  Having read the ""monk who sold his Ferrari"",  this is my second one. Loved the productivity boosting tools and self care routines recommended in this book beyond the 20/20/20 formula. Robin Sharma's storytelling is amusing and you cannot help but fall in love with his characters - the artist, the entrepreneur, the Billionaire and the spellbinder. I'm looking forward to trying the 66 day habit installation routine using the app and bring some order to my life by focusing on things that matter most as well as cutting out the noise by being more self aware. This is more than a book or novel. It's a guided manual on self mastery that anyone and everyone can use to elevate their lives. Must read!

  I‚Äôm screaming out of frustration after reading this book. Such a pathetic and unnecessary explanation of each and every character and irrelevant description. I don‚Äôt get how this book has got so many good reviews - so many of these reviews are either paid or readers are pretty new to reading...If you have been reading books since long and have a really good taste in self development books then this book is not for you.Update1: I‚Äôm currently at page 158, completed chapter 11 and still not liking this book. Each and every description/scene is too stretched until you get frustrated. There were times when I forgot that I‚Äôm reading a self-development book and thought I‚Äôm reading fictional fantasy!!! To be very honest if I‚Äôd be generous enough to say that I‚Äôve found 5% motivation/education related to 5AM club and elevating mornings.I‚Äôll soon post 2nd review after completing this book!! (I still have hopes to find at least some motivation in the 2nd half)Update2 : I would say I tried so hard to like this book but unfortunately I couldn‚Äôt!! Chapter-11,12,13 seems little bit relevant to the title but again, everything after that looses plot... This book should‚Äôve been 50 pages only because that‚Äôs much is about 5am and everything else is unnecessary lectures which you can hear anywhere on social media nowadays.Final thoughts: Not really impressed with this book. Very lengthy and unnecessary descriptions of each and every character/clothes/looks/expressions/surroundings ahhhhh.... looses plot so many times, in so many chapters and don‚Äôt discuss much relevant to the title..

  The writing is really terrible. The author should have just outlined his ideas instead of jamming every motivational quote he's ever heard down the throats of his one dimensional characters.

  Wowed. Robin expertly weaves his lessons on early rising and personal mastery into an adventure anyone would want to go on. I'm not into fiction but I love what this has done to my brain.I am admittedly not a reader of fiction, but I consider Robin Sharma a mentor, having been through his Mastery Sessions and having practiced his 20-20-20 5am formula off and on for the past 3-4 years. So when he chose to make this crown jewel teaching a fiction piece, I had to trust him. I'm so glad I did.Keeping an open mind I read Robin Sharma's 5 am Club. My opinion is that the fictional account of the eccentric billionaire and two seekers gave my mind more to grab hold of to drive the lessons deeper.Thank you Robin!Laura Gabriele@sacredambition on Instagram

  Everything about this book is great. I bought it because I really wanted to learn how to wake up earlier and get a productive start to my day.The book is set up to give a story rather than just tips and tricks. It does a really good job of keeping the reader engaged throughout the story, and making you want to finish the book. The only problem I have is the digital content that comes along with the book. There‚Äôs an app that allows you to stay accountable to your 5am routine.

  There‚Äôs good stuff in here - sound principles, good advice - but oh my word how much nonsense you have to slog through to get it. I guess the author thinks his principles were better presented in a story, and they might have been, if the story was well written, which it is decidedly not. Really it‚Äôs kind of disrespectful to the reader to waste so much time on this. Too bad the interesting information wasn‚Äôt presented simply and in a straightforward fashion, in far fewer pages (although more evidence for the superiority of these principles would also have been welcome). My advice is skip to the learning aids then skim the content for further explanations. The 2 stars are only for the ideas, or this would be 1 star.

  Love the story form of this book. Best personal development book I‚Äôve read to date. One critique I have is the lack of diversity in the legends mentioned in the book ( Benjamin Franklin, Edison, Einstein, Steve jobbs, etc). It would have been great to learn about other legends of the world of different ethnic and cultural backgrounds so that more readers can see themselves represented in the story (pushing past the temptation to reference people and cultures that we already know about that can reinforce the narrative that white, western minds are the greatest/smartest, etc). Maybe the next book could include legends like Maya Angelou, Alfredo Bowman, George Washington Carver, Harriet Tubman, Madam CJ Walker.

Definitely has some insightful ways to improve your morning and/or daily routine.Started on August 9, 2020 & finished on October 31, 2020 - 83 days.

  A lot of really great recommendations for day-building and architecture. As well as some beautiful prose. While the story is a bit sappy, I think it is all a tool to pace out the delivery of high-impact information. This book gives more of a synopsis of many key tools in Sarma‚Äôs toolkit, although few specifics. In depth discussion of them will need to be pursued elsewhere, this book is a series of ‚Äútake-away messages.‚Äù But overall the 5AC left me feeling very excited and inspired to start rousing myself early at 5 AM, and also experimenting with several other pearls of daily scheduling that he describes. Additionally I loved the quotes he has collected throughout the text.

  While there are certainly good ideas and inspirational quotes present, they are buried amidst heaps of poor writing. Wake up early and form good habits - I just saved you a few bucks and many hours of frustration.I don't typically leave reviews, especially negative one, but this book had me so frustrated I needed to let others know. You can find better sources of the same information because there aren't really new ideas here, just a collection of other people's work.

  Sharma leads the personal development genre with this work. There are books that talk the talk, but this one walks the walk. It‚Äôs inspiring and practical. Yes, odd at times, as noted by critics, but its oddities take their shape from great works such as ‚ÄúThe Alchemist.‚Äù Its only flaw is that it didn‚Äôt come with a celebratory worm at the end for budding early birds.

  After leaving the military, I left some of my discipline behind because I felt my meaning was lost in so many ways. My mentor introduced me to Robin's work. First it was Extraordinary Leadership, The Monk who Sold His Ferrari, now this book. Robin explains in plain terms what many of us already know but have failed to do - break the loop and creating new habits that will elevate your life. Thus far by following the plan layed out in this book, I have already yielded remarkable results. I applaud the 90/90/1 and 60/10 methods. It all works.
