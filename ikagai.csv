  The book does a decent job of relating the concept of Ikigai to modern day psychology (with Frankl's Logotherapy from Man's Search for Meaning among others) and a few scientific references in a simple manner. It talks about how purpose plays an important role in a man's life and the different ways in which it manifests itself. It also tackles some ways to 'find your flow' and ensure that what you do receives 100% of your attention and that you enjoy whatever you are creating.The book also discusses certain other Japanese concepts like takumi (specialized workers) and moai (connections with community or friend-circle). The brief discussions have the benefit of being to the point and simple but also pose the risk of trivializing them into regular self-help advice. The book also delves into Japanese perspectives on living life and persevering without getting caught up in artificially-created urgency. But again, maybe the authors wished for the readers to research more or meditate more on the content given the concise treatment of the same.The chapters on diet and exercises have more details and thus, may be more useful. Certain foods are dealt with in greater detail as is the concept of 'hara hachi bu' wherein one eats only 80% of what would actually assuage his hunger. The chapter on exercises includes illustrations and steps. While they may suffice for some of the purposes mentioned in the book - the philosophy behind them, progressive increments and other essential details are missing or insufficient.I was interested in the concept of Ikigai and wanted to read more about it. Despite being well-written and presenting modern applications, the book did not fulfill my requirements at all. Some of the condensed content made me think that the extended research, including on-site interviews, done by the authors for writing this book was clearly lost in translation or presentation in certain parts.The hardcover is pretty and soothing with its matte texture. Inner pages are smooth and heavy with a cream tinge. The font size is good. The spine as well as pages hold up well. Overall, the book is quite light and sturdy. Bought it for INR 460 against MRP of INR 499.

  I personally believe that having a purpose on in life and then giving it your all is the most important to lead a happy life. This book validates so.Ikigai is a short but not very short book based on a Japanese concept. According to this concept, we find the deeply sown purpose of our lives from within ourselves by defining our passion, mission, vocation and profession. It gives you tips as to how the simplest things in our life, like sometimes, taking a pause, are what will give us a long and happy life.I bought a hardcover because of it‚Äôs extremely pretty cover. The cover itself will soothe your mind whenever you look at it. The title does go with the book but personally for me, not as I thought it would.If you are expecting it to help you find your Ikigai, give you step by step solution as to how you can find it and reward it with millions of dollars, you‚Äôll be disappointed. This book is full of facts, real life experience from Japan‚Äôs Okinawa and compels you to focus more on you : your health, your choices, your focus and your inner happiness. It will probably be the only book you‚Äôll come across that tells you to take it, relax, but also burn in your passion.The language is as simplistic and beautiful as the cover and it‚Äôs content. Not many tough words and very beginner-friendly in the reading world. The structure to is great with a prologue, 9 chapters, an epilogue and a list of more suggestions for you to explore in the end.Coming to the overall feel of the book, it‚Äôs very cozy. In it‚Äôs own way, it also does help you slightly to find your own Ikigai.I thought it would be a full on hustle kind of book but I felt relaxed after this read. I was ready to take on my tasks stress-free. Though it is not something extremely crazy and different, it definitely is a one-time read for all the hustlers or non-hustlers out there who think they have to punish themselves to get what they want.

  IkigaiThe Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy LifeBy Hector Garcia and Francesc MirallesI will be confessing by saying that i bought this book just because of its attractive cover, such a soothing color combination which itself calmed me.This book is all about finding your passion in life, your ‚Äúikigai‚Äù which will help you to live a happy, content, active and long life. It talks about art of staying young while growing old, about relaxing, about not running behind materialistic things, how to improve your performance in daily routine and to stay focused.One of the best lesson which I liked was how to be more anti fragile. It talked about  creating more options, by devoting time in your passion, taking small risks for increasing your experience and to get rid of the things which makes us more fragile.Before reading this book I felt that there would be some manoeuvre to follow for finding your ikigai, but there is just overview of many therapies which left me little unsatisfied and disappointed. There were few things like proverbs, quotes and traditions from centritains which I found were not really required. There is no rocket science written in this book but some of the facts are eye opening.P. S . And seriously I wish I could learn sun salutation and other exercise by reading.Overall I will say it‚Äôs a easy, simple read for beginners for setting up small goals.Only staying active will make you want to live a hundred years.‚Äî‚Äî-Japanese proverbBook starts with this proverb and this literally summarises the book.

  Except for a few pieces of wisdom, most of the book feels preachy, very much like a sales pitch and boring too. There's no flow or continuity which makes one feel as if they're reading a college student's thesis report.

  Ikigai - Book reviewA pure GEM. Short (1 hour to finish), massively impactful & UPLIFTING.Ikigai is a Japanese concept, which means ‚Äúthe happiness of always being busy"". It explains the extraordinary longevity of the Japanese, especially on the island of Okinawa, wherethere are 24.55 people over the age of 100 for every 100,000 inhabitants!What I LOVED about the book is a reiteration of FACTS that we all know. Best ones:- Never RETIRE. (If you have recently retired parents who are grumpy & throw tantrums, give them this book)- Stop eating JUST when you are about to get full. ‚ÄúHara hachi bu"" means something like ‚ÄúFill your belly to 80 percent.‚Äù- SLEEEEEP!!! Top models sleep a lot!- How to handle thoughts, emotions, BOREDOM. Vietnamese monk Thich Nhat Hanh, who would say, ‚ÄúHello, solitude. How are you today? Come, sit with me, and I will care for you.‚Äù- A list of different Japanese meditations & practices.- The Pomodoro Technique to FOCUS : Get yourself a kitchen timer & commit to working on a single task as long as it‚Äôs running.If you want a long, fulfilling life, get this book.

  To be completely honest I bought this book just because of its cover. I mean just take a moment and observe it, the perfect shade of blue with white flowers. Simplicity at its best. This book has some sort of vibe, I still remember how I smiled when I opened the amazon parcel and found this bundle of positivity and happiness. The sheer pleasure of caressing its pages which is very different as compared to the regular pages of other novels, it gives you immense relief Idk how and why, but it does. Coming to the main content, the book starts by telling the meaning of Ikigai i.e.,purpose of your life, reason to get out of your bed every morning happily and how finding your Ikigai will lead to a long and happy life. The importance of society and a friendly neighbourhood is well put.The interviews of the Japanese Centenarians explains why they are the longest living human beings on this planet, they do the simple activities like gardening also with full enthusiasm, they aren‚Äôt spending their retirement resting on an arm chair instead they attend Karaoke nights, indulge in group activities, sell their produce in vegetable market and believe in eating simple and exercising.They live in present and enjoy every moment happily. Because being aware of the impermanence of things does not have to make us sad; it should help us love the present and those who surround us.'ü¶ãOur Ikigai is different for all of us but one thing we have in common is that we are all searching for meaning. There is no perfect strategy of connecting with our ikigai. But what we learned from the Okinawans is that we should not worry too much about finding it. Like the author said ‚ÄúLife is not a problem to be solved. Just remember to have something that keeps you busy doing what you love while being surrounded by the people who love you‚Äù. The simplest things are often the most beautiful, and this book is the perfect example of this statement. ' Eat right, exercise, and do what makes you happy'...by following this motto, we can definitely find our 'ikagai', our reason to live.

  Easy read. A few good rules stood out for me. For eg 80% rule on food and being stoic and imagining the worse daily to liberate yourselves of fears. There are plenty such as rules, you can choose what you like. The description of Japanese community that practices ikigai seemed simplistic and far cry from from the city life.The key question is finding your ikigai in this fast paced world. The book will give you hints, but ultimately you still need to find it yourselves. Anyway I give this book a sure thumbs up.

  Ikigai is a book every bookshelf ought to have. Its philosophy of holistic living, purposeful journeying of life, is a philosophy to apply daily in life. The authors make valid connections to unite mind and body, heart and soul, in the experiment to find the Inner Self and live by Its values. After all, the rat race makes for the dead race! To really live, one has to listen within and express ones talents, values, ethics in daily living through correct action. In India, Ikigai has existed for eons, but this is another, more modern easy to follow path of inner realisation. I love the book!The physical book is beautiful too. Well bound, with thread bound pages, hard cover and pretty picture on it.

  This book is very different from the too technical ones already present out there on the same topic. Ikigai (book) was like a flow, exactly like the flow which it asks us to find in our lives. It is very crisp and to the point.It's talks about few things we already know but need to be reminded. Things we have learnt or heard of on the way of life, but all those needed to be collected in one place and this book is that place. We humans, in this current age, are running behind things without any meaningful outcome. But somewhere we had to be reminded that this is not what makes a happy life. And this is that reminder. Search for ikigai begins where the book ends.üôÇA quote from the book: ""Life is not a problem to be solved. Just remember to have something that keeps you busy doing what you love while being surrounded by the people who love you.""It's no doubt a must read for everyone. It may not alter your life altogether but it will surly make a difference however small is might be.

  The book deals with the Japanese concept of Ikigai and is focused on how we can find happiness in our work. The authors discuss the japenese concept rather superficially and the subject lacks depth and an overall sense of wholesomeness that is annoying at times.There are a number of other books which one might refer to gain some good life advice such as 'How will you measure your life' by C.M. Christensen or 'My Gita' by D. Pattanaik.

  The title of the book suggests that it is unravelling The Japanese Secrets to a Long and Happy Life, but it also does incorporate the key elements from Indian way of life i.e.Yoga and the Chinese way of life i.e. Tai Chi. Indeed the key point that emerges from the book is that one should keep on moving and not spend most of the time of the day either sitting or lying down.It also dispels the notion that one should start withdrawing from the activities after one is officially retired and advocated that staying active is what would be the deciding factor if one aspires to complete a century on this planet- which incidentally is a Japanese quote from where the book starts. Does it not seem so pertinent in the times that we are living in- the Corona times. IKIGAI actually means living a meaningful life. Though Japan is a major rice growing country, the book advocates drawing from the patterns of food from people residing in Okinawa in Japan is that the food plate construct on a daily basis should be dominated by vegetables and Tofu,  and there is a particular emphasis on the size of the plate. The plate should not be large, as we normally have in Indian conditions but it should be of medium size.However  one may be hungry, one should aspire to eat 80% only which is called as Hara hachi bu in Japanese and were we to follow the maxim it would take care of quite a lot of health related issues that we are confronted with, associated with over eating.Interestingly enough Japanese have been practising the concept of saving called as Moai-where farmers get together to share best practices and also help one another with meager harvests. In the times of distress that the farming community is in the country, can we aspire to have such kind of a group of farmers. Farmers Producers Organizations have been formed but they need to converge to the concept of Moai to make it really effective.This group also had the provision of a monthly contribution akin the idea of SELF HELP GROUPS with a difference that the contribution is utilised for social activities and left over from the contribution is given a member based on his requirements.The book has tried to assimilate other such initiatives from around the world but the bottom line is that one has to find flow in everything that one is doing.  There should not be any distraction or multi-tasking at all as it does not help anyway. To attain the flow, the authors have requested to adopt the policy of leaving the cell phones one hour before going to sleep, and one hour after getting up. Tough act to adopt? Each one of us has a passion inside us or the Ikigai and if we have found it we need to practice and fine tune it, and if not yet, it is incumbent upon us to discover it.NALIN RAI

  We all want to lead a long and healthy life. Don‚Äôt we? Ikigai has all the elements to decode it. Ikigai is a Japanese word, translates to ‚Äú the happiness of always being busy or engaged‚Äù.  The people of Okinawa live a simple outdoor life, drink green tea, and eat a healthy diet served in a special bowl that limits to their eating. The book explains that every being has an Ikigai, a journey of self-discovery and it‚Äôs worth the search. Ikigai draws attention to the lifestyle of Japanese people showcasing how they lead an optimal healthy life, filled with happiness, and longevity. The main focus is on diet, daily activities and a sense of joy. It also includes wisdom from supercentenarians(above the age of 110) from all over the world.Every individual's Ikigai is different but the search is common. Still searching for you Ikigai, no worries, smile, take a long breath and find one. I‚Äôm all praises for this book and cannot stop gushing about it. Grab it today.

  Ikigai came to me at a moment when I was feeling distracted and lost from my ultimate goal. Also, I really feel sad to see my 75 plus mom in law and 65 plus mom to see sticking to bed and complaining that they are good for nothing now. I don‚Äôt want to be one of these old women who can‚Äôt rejoice life anymore, I wish to have both mental and physical strength in my old age too that‚Äôs why I have entertained Yoga to my daily routine.The book starts with Japanese proverb ‚ÄúOnly staying active will make you want to live a hundred years‚Äù and it touches the art of staying young while growing old and also shares antiaging secrets. It also recommends to find flow in everything you doand master longevity. It gives a comparison of logotherapy of psychotherapy and prefers the previous. Apart from that, the book also tells the experience tales of centenarians as how they made it upto living longer and healthier life. The diet and exercise carry an essential ingredient in a perfect recipe of life.‚ÄúNana Korobi Ya Oki/ Fall seven times, rise eight‚Äù is the key to remain antifragile and be resilient to deal with the setbacks. Follow the philosophies of Budhism and Stoicism which aim at practicing well being while you are enjoying life‚Äôs pleasures. According to stoicism, we should be able to control our emotions and curb our ego and negative emotions.I even loved the ‚Äòwabi sabi‚Äô and ‚Äòichi-go ichi-e‚Äô concepts which tell us that instead of looking for beauty in perfection, we should look out beauty in the given things-the things  that are incomplete and temporary.Although the content on Yoga is something I just skipped because these were known facts and considerations.On the whole, Ikigai is a beautiful gift to the society. It leads you from darkness to light and follow a right path to healthy lifestyle. Worry less, Walk an extra mile and Weigh your burdens less. A good diet and some sort of exercise is needed to be added. Above all, everyone must have some purpose in life. It is the reason to live ‚Äòikigai‚Äô and not anything else,  which keeps you going. The authors Hector Garcia and Francesc Miralles stress on never retire policy so as to stay young inside.

  First the good part - chapter IX on ‚ÄòAnti-fragility‚Äô, which discuss stoicism and similar Buddhist teachings are the best parts of the book. Already well known (to me), but nice to be reinforced about those principles. The epilogue nicely summarises the entire premise of the book.The bad part  the book are those sections which seems to promote pseudo-science when it comes to discussing diet and the benefits of certain types of food items. I will be the last person to take those things by face value. Also, the book described the lifestyle of the centenarians as if they were living that way their whole life (singing, dancing, tending to their garden), which is simply not true. I was more interested in knowing how they lead their earlier years - the young adult and Middle Ages - because that is where the key to longevity lies (not only in how they spent their old age).

  I found it more like a wellness blog. I bought this book after coming across the IKIGAI venn diagram shared in an online session about life's purpose. The diagram explores 4 vocational elements namely what you love, what you are good at, what the world needs and what can be paid for. The idea is to choose a career that qualifies on these 4 elements. I bought the book to explore more about this concept. But the book is not about the diagram, it is about general principles of a happy and long life that are practiced in a small town Okinawa in Japan. It is a good read but my expectation were a lot more. I later did some search and came across this link that says the the creator of the diagram is not even a Japanese and had only listened to a ted talk about IKIGAI. This is a weird world. Anyway, can't discredit the book, it is a good read but know that it is not about the diagram that helps you choose a right career.

  Ikigai is my first self-help/philosophy book and I'm glad I picked it. We know how to deal with our lives, we know how to make it simpler, less stressful but somewhere in the race of life we forget that. Ikigai was that reminder. The book is written in simple language and is easy to read. However, it can be ""just"" a read or a read if the reader wants; one may finish it in a few days or in a few months depending upon how impactful the written words are. For a reader who enjoys self-help books, Ikigai might, might, not serve  anything different but for first timers, it sure did. Happy Reading !! :)

I knew about Intangible treasures of India- Saathvik diet, Yoga, Prayers, Meditation etc.... This book unravelled me to the Intangible world of Japanese... It appears to be as rich as Ours.....

  Hey there, I would be happy to review this book as I was eager to buy the book on amazon. But due to the pandemic I bought the kindle version of it. I am really happy to have this book in my kindle bookstore. This book is a must read to those who are keen readers of Self help books or those who want to learn a culture, lifestyle and more about Japan. Japan is one of my favorite destinations and so this book was one of my must buy books. The author has given lots of information about the Centenarians, what they eat, how they work, the style they live and what keeps them so alive till the age of 100 years. It is so thrilling while reading this book, that anyone who is fond of Japanese people will love to read and follow their routine style. It has mentioned about the Yoga that is originated in India. The readers will get lot of useful information and you will imagine those great people who have made it up to 100 years with all the enthusiasm and  passion towards their life.

  I feel the title is inappropriate.The book talks of many things but the core of it is ‚Äúhow to live a long and happy life‚Äù.It is not about how to discover your passion i.e. ikigaiIt is just an few page introduction to the concept of ikigai and that is where I was disappointed. I didn‚Äôt get what I bought for.But overall it is a good and light read. Scrapping and introducing few concepts of holistic health.

  There are three parts to the book. Start, middle and end.Start and end are really interesting, thought middle somehow moved towards what I was not expecting, but the end nailed the expectations. There are many beautiful learnings as a key take-away and if we start implementing, it might take years but we can reach the goal. One should read the book and implement in real life.

  I started reading Ikigai, the book by Hector Garcia and Frances Mirales. It is a really short book but so profound when it comes to the real reason why Okinawans from Japan live the longest. They are called super centenarian. They eat about 18 varieties of food every day, the move a lot basically do a lot of gardening and walk and lot of community work, and drink a special kind of tea made from local fruit. They also do radio taiso exercise of basically five minutes. More importantly, the book talks about doing what you love to do. When you are one with your activity and your concentration is high that means you are in flow and very few people can do that - to maintain the flow is the challenge. It is basically all that you give to a given moment whether you do yoga, or look after a baby, cook for your family, nurture your plants... you are one with that moment and that if you repeatedly do, that gets you in flow. The book is full of interesting examples that keep you turning the page and in my case swiping left. I really enjoyed the book which is essentially about how to stay in the flow in the given moment and such a fun read.

  Just peppering the word ‚Äúikigai‚Äù throughout the book doesn‚Äôt make the book about that. There is very little insight in here from essentially Japanese sources or culture, including those in setting the premise or explaining the concept. Essentially feels like the authors found a fascinating Japanese concept, but were too consumed (and possibly self-absorbed) to do justice to it as an independent subject. It should have been a short article instead.

  This is one of the books that I was longing to own and read. I was expecting that this book would detail more on the venn diagram illustrated behind the book to find our real purpose in life, but I was a little disappointed when this book was more inclined towards the secrets to life over a 100 years. It is true that the title is specified as 'Japanese secret to a long and happy life', but this book focuses more on the 'long' part than the 'happy' part. To a person who believes that life is meant to be larger and not longer (like me) , this book might turn you off. Also most of the contents in this book quote statements and anecdotes from other books. Out of 10 chapters, only two chapters talk about the path to choose our ikigai, and the rest on increasing our lifespan.. Happy reading.

  The book delves in many aspects of living a longer and most importantly a happier or content life. Many of the secrets are not so much of secrets, internally we all are aware of them; it is the practise that makes all the difference.

There is only one thing for it then‚Äîto learn. Learn why the world wags and what wags it. That is the only thing which the mind can never exhaust, never alienate, never be tortured by, never fear or distrust, and never dream of regretting.‚Äù

  Our ikigai is different for all of us, but one thing we have in common is that we are all searching for meaning.‚Äù‚Äï Hector Garcia PuigcerverThe word 'IKIGAI' is a Japanese concept which means ""a reason for being"". It refers that one must have a purpose in life which will make their life worthwhile, and for this one must take some willing actions to feel satisfied and have some meaning to life.This book mainly tells that every single person has their own ikigai. Every person finds an ikigai at a certain point of life. Our ikigai is different from others and is hidden deep inside us. Once a person discovers his or her ikigai, it brings meaning to their lives. It is not like that a person has no meaning of living. The books  notifies various methods using which a person can find their purpose in life. A person can find their purpose by doing different activities till they don't feel cheerful and pleased doing it.So far as liking this book, it was good. It had some motivational lessons to improve our lives. Also had some ways following which one could refine lives. But the way it was written did not have much impact on me as every chapter till the end had same things repeated in different ways. It is a bit overrated!

  I have always wondered about the Japanese spirit of resilience and rebirth. How do they live so long? How are they so productive to the end of their days? How do they have such excellent physiques? Most importantly, what gives them the tenacity to never give up even in the face of the most extreme odds (the aftermath of the WW2 being an example, out of which the Japanese only came out stronger)?The answer is in this book, and it is Ikigai.Ikigai doesn't just preach; it peppers itself with several examples and anecdotes, including tips from the supercentenarians of the world (those who have lived beyond 110 years). It gives thorough advice on enriching various aspects of life.I strongly recommend this book to all of us who are still looking for meaning in our lives, who feel that life is out to get them at every moment, who are, simply, too overwhelmed by everything that's going on around. Do pause awhile, and immerse yourself in this world of Ikigai and you'll come out richer.And, since I heard the audiobook on Audible, I'd put a word of recommendation for that too. Brilliantly narrated, with the right pauses and inflections and the calls to action.

  I love the concept of this book but I understood it in the first twenty pages. What follows seemed like a diversion. For me, ikigai is the driving purpose of my life. It keeps me motivated and happy and somehow the book shifted from a happy purposeful life, to a long life which I did not really like. Focus was having a long life with happy being implied, while I would have preferred it to be the reverse. The book is good but did not live upto to my expectations. Also, I felt that the methods and habits are not always feasible for urban people which should have been considered in the book. It felt like a collection of interview excerpts. The cover is beautiful and soothing but in my opinion the book is good for beginners. It did not live upto the hype around it and yet again I felt that I should never read hyped books.

  üíó"" Being aware of the impermanence of things does not have to make us sad; it should help us love the present and those who surround us"".üçÅIn today's busy and stressful world, it can be very difficult to find your 'ikagai'- your reason to start your day with smile by doing things which you love.

  I recently completed reading a very inspiring book ‚Äî IKIGAI ‚Äî The Japanese Secret to a Long Happy Life. The book is authored by Hector Garcia and Francesc Miralles. In this article, I am going to talk about my learning from the book.The book touches the various aspects of life which can help us achieve a long happy life. It is based on ancient, well practised Japanese technique called ‚Äî IKIGAI.If you google the word, you will get various meanings like-A reason for being, encompassing joy, a sense of purpose and meaning and a feeling of well-beingORThe word derives from iki, meaning life and kai, meaning the realisation of hopes and expectations.But the one I liked the most is ‚ÄîA reason to jump out of bed each morning!This book draws a lot of references from an island in Japan called ‚Äî Okinawa where there 24.5 inhabitants of age more 100 for every 1,00,000 people.book explains how stress, a lot sitting adds up to your age and makes reduces your life duration. Interesting it also mentions very prominently that little stress is good for you since it keeps you going. I firmly believe ‚Äî Being Conscious of Your Daily Routine Can Lead to A Better Life!it helps you deep dive into discovering the meaning of your life. It is quite evident that the authors stress more on discovering the meaning of life rather than creating one for you!This part is my most favourite where the authors helps you find the meaning of being in the flow. If you have discovered the meaning of your life, you need to completely immerse into the experience without being distracted by the surroundings and you attain the flow.There are several more techniques like wabi sabi..This techniques talks about finding beauty in imperfect, incomplete things. Here flawed is preferred over perfection. Japanese believe that only imperfect, incomplete and ephemeral things are beautiful because they resemble the nature.To conclude, I think the book is extremely inspiring and full of content. I could attain my flow while reading it. Loved it ! Highly recommended reading ‚Äî You can buy the book on Amazon!Hope it was helpful.Thanks for reading.

  In a bid to simplify my overtly success-loaded, busy, rapid-fire life, I had lifted this book off a mall in Delhi, mostly out of desperation for liberation.Every day I practiced the art of the flow as stated in the book---being in the flow with whatever it is that you are doing so that you become one with the work---and slowly and steadily changes began infiltrating my life.I wrote a poem as a way to describe flow in writing (this is something hardcore writers will relate to):""This desire arises whenever I write,And am undesirous of the slightest respite,A non-existent realm beyond the logical‚Äôs sight,This world the rational forever pleads to bite.This realm exists so we, writers, never die,A spotless sea so lucid you could really cry,No inhibitions, praises and critics we bid goodbye,Where we will always be and never need to try.Because that‚Äôs what we are and have always been,Immortal yes, this realm does exist for I have seen,So while you folks measure our worth being mean,We travelled miles away and expand into the unseen.""(The title of the poem I had given as ""Could I be Immortal?)Flow is a state where you are inseparable from that which you are involved in. Once in this state, you work at your best, and experience bliss.  In the state of flow you dont experience ay resistance whatsoever and hence you experience an eternity and the desire for immortality for contemplative minds like mind could be a natural result!the book speaks about the researched lives and way of living of the largest number of centenarians in the world---ie. in Japan. What they eat, how they live everyday, the way they think, how they live minimalistic lives and sink into a state of flow in their pursuits, foods they refrain from and spiritual practices they practise daily.Powerful book for people wanting to simplify their lives! Please go ahead and buy the boy! It isn't the usual kind of self-help books that you would wish to push aside. This is well-researched work!Simple, obscure living, all wrapt up in the flow is powerful and the best way to live, in my opinion!

  I am thanking Kindle Unlimited for sending my way all the good and powerful books. I happened to finish this one in 40 minutes. No, I wasn't counting time while reading it but the book is very short and takes you to the journey of self discovery. I knew about this book for long as I have always seen it in the collection of street vendors. But reading it along with appropriate examples was an enthralling experience. The biggest thing I wanted to learn was a difference between happiness and joy and this book made me believe that I have been more joyful than happy. I accept it by now. Also, it talks about finding the true purpose in life. I hope you all find yours as I have found mine and it is keeping me on the right track of penning my world into words.

  Truth to be told I am not much fan of #NonFiction especially #selfhelpbooks . I do like memoirs or autobiographies of they are from people I love and admire but everytime I pick a self help book I just can't go beyond a few pages. As much as I can related with the words in those books I just can apply them.in my life and they put me in big slumber. And as a result I have been avoiding self help books for quite a while!.But this book #ikigai has been an exception to them. This is the only self help book in my life that I have not dnf'd and I keep on reeding a chapter or two every next few days. So, it can be said that this one is my favorite self help book

  Quote from the book:""Only staying active will make you want to live a hundred years.""Food for thought:The first thought that pops up in a conversation regarding this book is the title. Ikigai translates into an abstract form of expression unbound by ""the happiness of always being busy.""The concept and philosophy of longevity are drawn from the Okinawa tribe in Japan. The fact that the majority number of centenarians hails from their humble abode leaves one confounded. The Village of Longevity, as it's rightly called, has its allure in its simple living and minimalistic instincts.As we embark upon the mission to find our ikigai, there are snippets of facts that can hold one's attention far longer than one would expect from a self-help book. The interwoven display of our very own being is primary and easy to understand.It is a book like no other! You will be exercising not only your mind and body but also your spirit.Ikigai has redefined my consciousness and revealed the pure bliss of living. Let not fear crinkle your eyes or stress wrinkle your foreheads. The true spirit of the book is in its lucid language and beautiful analogies.There is a sense of calm and acceptance that flows throughout the book. Holistic living and mindfulness are essential for making conscious decisions. Prudent choices leave an impact more prominent than any force trying to shape our tomorrow.Disclaimer:It will anchor your thoughts and ground your feelings.My favorite part of the book is anecdotes from the people who live to be 110 years of age or more. I was stumped by the stories and couldn't believe it at first glance. The proof was right there in their recounted tales as I kept gaping at the pages in disbelief.

  Ikigai - The Japanese Secret to long and happy life.The book touches various aspects of life which can help us achieve a long and better life. Basically, it beautifully explains the deep art of staying young while growing old. Various real-life examples are cited, especially with reference to Okinawa, a Japanese island inhabiting people with higher life expectancy.It is quite evident that the authors stress more on discovering the meaning of life rather than creating one for you. Most importantly, the book helps us in finding the meaning of being in the 'flow' and how to achieve the 'flow'.The book concludes after introducing another Japanese Technique called ‚Äî Wabi-Sabi - finding beauty in imperfect, incomplete things. Here flawed is preferred over perfection. Japanese believe that only imperfect, incomplete and ephemeral things are beautiful because they resemble the nature.To conclude, I think the book reading experience was as beautiful as the book cover. It can be read in just 4 hours as it only has around 200 pages. But those 4 hours can be life altering and the readers have high chances of keeping the teachings of this book in their mind for very long.

  This was marked as the best seller on the subject (Ikigai) on Amazon. I was keen to learn about the concept (Ikigai) but the book didnt help in that direction.It is more focussed on how one can be living a long and happy life like the Japanese do. There are few good chapters and couple of completely out of place ones too. E.g. There was no need to try teaching Yoga in few pages. I would have picked a different book if that was my objective. Few excerpts are scientific (reminded me of my school books) and few are way too shallow.However, the end makes it up by summarizing everything you read. Keep expectations correct while you pick this one.

  The book is engaging and portrays a fluent meaning of what makes life truly enjoyable and worth. It had drawn me to a spiritual yet practical way of viewing what exactly ""living"" is and the anecdotes they quoted throughout the story fascinated and clearly immersed me into a sense of fulfilment. In a baffling world, we live in, it's apparent that being stressed is a total normal thing and the book illustrates that ""a busy life is a wasted life"", it stimulates the reader to find elation in what they do and to relinquish every single second in tranquillity. I love how they referred to exercises and diets which I indeed found insightful. It's compelling and exquisitely presented.

  Ok the concept of Ikigai is brilliant and I really appreciate the authors‚Äô desire to learn and publish. But the meat of the book is the last two pages. Tops,  It should have been a fifty page book, but the authors went on to cover topics on spirituality and philosophies, which in my opinion have zero connection to Ikigai. Also I would have loved to learn the authors‚Äô perception of what they observed.

  The book gives a brief about the ikigai or chi. Which is present in all of us, but yet to achieve. I have a thing for Japanese culture, the way they are so meticulous about everything.

  I read this book on somebody's recommendation. The book is about people living in an island called Ogimi in Japan where people are long lived and live a very healthy life. It basically tells us how  these people have cultivated few habits which helps them to live a long, happy and healthy life. It involves few set of practices which are also linked to Japanese culture. How these people live a simple community based life where they enjoy doing small things  and living happily together. It basically tells us how we can enjoy life by simply figuring out and doing what we enjoy ?  Simple life based on enjoying your purpose of being, but all it takes to figure out first. ie to find one's ikigai.

  At first I was sceptical about the book because self help books aren't my type but this turned out to be a great read.Actually I had to quit it first, seeing only examples of people who actually found their Ikigai and changed their way of living. But then I began it again, this time along with an Audiobook which helped me complete the book easily and that was my first audiobook experience as well.Now back to the book, in further chapters it talks less about your passion and more about, importantly, a calmer and peaceful way of life. It talks about taking it slow, eating right, rejoicing with good friends, excercise, smile, being grateful and reconnecting to nature. I loved the book!

  A cleverly marketed book with a catchy cover that opens your pocket easily...But having read it, i must say that the content and the treatment of the theme or subject is very shallow. For a naive reader the material may appear nice with a diverse variety of Japanese terms sprinkeled all over. References to a whole lot of thinkers, writers adds to the charm.But the whole plot falls apart when it leaves youbwanting for more. This book is like a buffet of tiny little dishes from multiple cuisines. You get to sample them but thats it.Some examples cited are also ridiculous, for instance, the authir says that for years after the 2011 Tsunami that devastated Japan, the market boomed for Japanese construction companies. That according to the author makes those companies ""anti-fragile"", meaning something that gets stronger when harmed.  I dont get it at all. The tsunami did no direct harm to the construction companies so one is unable to appreciate how they got stronger after the calamity.If an occasional sprinkle of terms like Wabi-Sabi, Ichi-go, Ichi-e, hari-hachi-bu, mabui, tai chi, qigong and so on excite you - pick it up.The book really leaves you craving for more, an experience like when you order a full meal but are served small portions as if it was a side dish.

  The negative reviewers seem to have largely missed the point. Or to have been looking for something they will not find in a book. Yes there are chapters on diet and exercise, and the content of these is not particularly new or surprising (however irritating it may be, these things are indeed features of a healthy lifestyle).But there is a good deal more, including the sense of purpose and meaning that is common to those who have lived to an advanced age. The way this is explored and its links to, for example, logotherapy, are helpful and illuminating. Ikigai offers a genuine recipe for living a meaningful life if you are prepared to give it some time and thought.I strongly disagree with the reviewer who wanted it to be much longer! Most books are badly overwritten and in need of editing: the value of a book is in the quality of its content, not the number of pages it fills. This one is attractively presented, says what it needs to, then stops.

  I thought this book was going to go in depth into this Japanese philosophy called 'ikigai'. It was sadly, mostly about centenarians and how to live a healthy life (which constituted of all the cliche advice that you can read in an online article.

  Ikigai remains a ‚ÄòJapanese secret‚Äô having read this book. Not that I was expecting ‚Äòthe answer‚Äô but was expecting more of an analysis than drawing on occidental studies mostly from psychology to understanding a deeply oriental way of being.

  Okay. So, I normally balk at purchasing self help books and try to find some other way of gleaning the often infinitesimally small bit of useful information that they actually impart. Free months on kindle unlimited etc.If this book has done one thing, it is to reinforce that rule and remind me not to be so foolish in the future.For those of you that are considering buying this book but do not want to waste precious time, sifting through the 95% of this book that is, bulking, waffle, irrelevant, endless repetition of the work Ikigai and theories as to why people on Okinawa live longer than most on the planet....** There are two things that you need to know.1. Write down the activities, hobbies, work, that you do, that make you happy (you are half way through the book before they ask you to do this!). Things that not only make you smile and feel fulfilled but where the time passes noticeably more quickly because you are focussed on the enjoyable task at hand.2. Incorporate those activities as much as you can in your daily life.The answers are pretty much in front of you on the Amazon web page for this book. Just take a look at the pictures provided and work it out for yourself from there. It‚Äôs not rocket science.Good luck and live a happy and long life with an extra ¬£10 in your pocket.

  I'd seen this book in a well-known High Street booksellers; literally a few days later, it was one of the Kindle Daily Deal books for 99p..Some might see it as a part of the self-help book genre.  Read  it, do it, everything fixed.  And it might work for some on that level and good for that and them.I found the central idea affirming and matching ideas and thoughts from over the years  That coupled with the other ideas and material made for an interesting read that may cause you to 're-think' a 'few' things.On the Kindle version downside, there are drawings and diagrams at various points in the book and on my ancient Mark 1 Kindle they were largely unreadable [perhaps newer versions with higher dpi are better] but even so their size is also an issue. Despite that I found enough in the book to say I'm very glad I have read it and urge everyone to find their own Ikigai; you will likely benefit with greater longevity but also with potentially improved mental and physical health as well.

  Though I enjoyed the premise of this book, this has all been done before and as a result I don't think there is much that is new to be taken from this.However, I did enjoy seeing the practical side of Ikigai applied to the village of Ogimi and the data presented in real-time.With a huge emphasis of the book all about finding your flow and subsequently living a happier and healthier life all-round, much of this relates to common-sense.If you're after one book about gaining control of your life and reading up on ways to get to a better state of mind, then this is a good choice. But, if you're after a lot more enlightenment, I don't think you're going to get it from this rather short offering.

  An interesting take on the meaning of life; the conundrum we exist. The Japanese elderly in Ogimi and Okinawa generally have life figured out. Smile, do light exercise, walk a little daily, eat well, enjoy herbal tea and smile as a part of a community. While this book might present the 'knowns' of what it takes to be happy it weaves in a philosophy of serenity to the chaos that is daily life for most people in the west. It shows us we can be happy in finding our own purpose in life and that living our own ikigai we can have a wholesome existence fulfilling human nature in combination with our own desires.I gave this book four stars simply because I think something is missing, something that addresses those big existential questions I always have trouble understanding. Who we are, where we come from and why we're here in the first place.While I didn't find my own Ikigai by reading this book it did help me realise I need to find it. The authors, Hector Garcia and Francesc Miralles did a wonderful job of bringing some elderly wisdom to a world clearly in need. Worth every penny and a fluent comfortable read.If you're thinking about buying this stop thinking. Buy.

  If you've read Freakonomics, you'll see why.When talking about life expectancy authors rely heavily on interviews with long-living individuals to deduct the factors that contribute to their ability to live long. This is simply irrelevant. If you ask an average tall person, why they are tall, they would not be able to answer, and their ideas and intuition would be as good as yours.Authors have a very noble goal of finding the factors that increase one's life expectancy, but they do so without use of statistical analysis and or scientific methods often leading to humorous contradictions.Here's one example: ""during last 100 years, life expectancy increased in average 0.3 years per year"". ""Cavemen had much less stress than modern humans, since volumes of information and devices are contributing to the stress"". But why is then life expectancy growing proportionally to the development of media then? Maybe this informational stress *positively* correlates with life expectancy? Without proper research it is impossible to tell if values are correlated and if they have any reason-cause relations.I liked a chapter about author's experience in Ogimi in Okinawa was nevertheless very good. Not because the insights were valuable, but because of a vivid image of traditional Japan that authors have conveyed. This is the most authentic chapter and it deserves a separate book. I would read that book, not this one.Authors jump between subjects of mental health, having purpose in life, diet and exercise, compiling and reciting many other great books. From this perspective, the book was very valuable, since I learned about works of Nassim Nicholas Taleb and Viktor Frankl. I already knew about Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi and planned to read his book ""Flow"".Doing my own research on what authors have briefly mentioned I discovered several other areas of knowledge that I want to learn more about. This was the biggest value of this book.Lastly, authors start to jump over myriad of loosely-related subjects: diet and nutritions, meditation, spiritual practices, yoga, tai chi, and it all in just few words. Pictures of Tai Chi exercises together with the descriptive text looked like a waste of space in an already tiny book.I would not recommend to read the book, but instead read all the other books that this book borrowed ideas from.

  I found this to be one of the least captivating self-help books I have read to date. I was foolishly drawn in by the very nicely designed cover and assumed the content would follow suit, unfortunately this was not the case. This book is littered with constant repetition of very obvious and cliche advice. I struggled on through the boring anecdotes with the hope that it would live up to it's amazing reviews but I am still left wondering how this book has received such high praise.

  In brief; eat healthy, exercise, meditate, don't get too stressed, and sleep well. Examples of this taken from Japan.

It‚Äôs ikigai which contributes significantly in having a long and happy life, apart from their life style(especially diet and exercise routine).This book briefly explains the concept of Logotherapy (a branch of psychology which helps people find their purpose in life) and Ikigai is something similar to that, motivational force for everyday life.Ikigai is not something you can find just by reading this book overnight, you have to discover it patiently. Also this book is not exactly about how you can find your Ikigai; however, it offers various tips to find your own flow and ways to maintaining it. It has also explained contributing factors in longevity. On and all it was blissful read.

  Why are we here?  What is our purpose?  This book covers so much and covers the principles of Ikigai.  Focusing on Okinawa which is an island with one of the oldest populations - more people are 100 years old + than any other place.  The book covers finding flow in your life, diet, exercise.  It is a small book in dimension, but well written with a beautiful cover.  That in itself is pure beauty.I would have liked a little more detail from the Japanese people.

  I found Ikigai extremely insightful.I had come across the term before in my reading and wanted to know more about the concept and with this book I got more than just and understanding of Ikigai. The book was a well curated guide to purpose, which is the essence of ikigai, it pulled together a lots of philosophical links to other concepts and thinkers, some of whom were new to me, which will lead to a lot of fun rabbit-holes to jump into!The book challenged my expectations I expected a very deep dive into one concept but actually discovered that ikigai isn't as simple as this. I found some sections of the book more meaningful than others, with a couple seeming a bit superficial, but this was probably more to do with the subject I had already read.I think if you new to philosophy and in particular Eastern philosophy this book is a fantastic first step, if you are a practicing some of the concepts in the book already you may find some of the detail a bit light.

  In response to the criticisms of this book that I have read I would say  'true - this is not an academic appraisal of a Japanese philosophy; it is more than that'. This is a truly peaceful book. It seeks to inform and advise the reader. A lovely book that any reader can 'dip into', picking and choosing from a menu of life-enhancing habits. Ikigai does not seek to dictate to the reader. Rather, it offers a range of simple, satisfying steps to a happier, healthier and more fulfilling lifestyle. It should be available on prescription! 2020 must surely be the year to take what ideas we can and to shape our lives for the better x

  I like Japanese culture and heard this book positively reviewed on a popular radio show so thought i‚Äôd give it a go. Spoiler alert, it basically says eat less, exercise a bit and have loads of friends. I already knew that and could have saved myself a bit of money. It also implies scientists are wrong about aging ( and implies the author thinks we are only a few decades away from being able to live for ever, despite some sad but pretty heavy weight scientific evidence to the contrary). It is written in a very patronising style as if the author thinks the reader is 5 years old and does the usual thing of preaching that the author knows best and that if their life style doesn‚Äôt fit with yours then you are the one that‚Äôs wrong. I‚Äôve never been a fan of ‚Äúself help‚Äù books but after the rave reviews I thought i‚Äôd give this one a go. I think I know who it helped, or rather who‚Äôs bank balance it helped, and it‚Äôs not me. Put simply, if you have a bad lifestyle you are likely to have a shorter life than someone who exercises all the time, doesn‚Äôt drink, doesn‚Äôt really understand ( or want to understand ) how the universe works, gives their money away, doesn‚Äôt care about possessions, and eats lots of vegetables. Or you can have a slightly shorter life but have a bit of fun. I suspect i‚Äôve left it a bit late for the former.

  First of all the Diagramm pictured on the back is NOT IKIGAI !It's from Andres Zuzunaga and has been spread as the Ikigai Venn Diagramm, which has nothing to do with Ikigai itself !I find it highly concerning that someone who 'researched' Ikigai did not know this or even though still included it....Now that I got the bad things out of the way let's talk about the book itself:The book itself isn't that bad and actually covers core components of Ikigai (and doesn't include the Diagramm)...It's easy and quick to read with some interesting parts.The physical book itself i have to say is gorgeous...Nice to the touch, beautiful design and feels high quality in general.To conclude this review this book is a nice and quick read and looks really good on a bookshelf (if that matters to you).But keep in mind the Diagramm is not Ikigai and let it theirfore not taint your understanding of it.

  I am sorry but this book is very random. It feels like a compound of other people's discoveries, not even well told, and does not really add anything. I read ""Man's search for meaning"" by Viktor Frankl a few days before starting ""Ikigai"" and some concepts were simply transcribed without giving any comment...When I read the title and subtitle I expected a journey through a country distant from mine in space and from a cultural point of view, but got only frustration instead.A very good idea badly developed.

  Das Buch ist gut geschrieben und betrifft auch ein wirklich spannendes Thema, das sonst etwas im Schatten steht: Wie wird man alt und kann das auch geniessen. Da werden alle Aspekte angesprochen, von der Philosophie, Psychologie bis zur Ern√§hrung und sozialen Einbindung. Da gibt es auch einen Schnellkurs in Yoga, Tai-chi usw, sehr kurz aber vielleicht ausreichend. Es stehen zwar Japan und die langlebigen Menschen von Okinawa im Vordergrund, aber auch andere Aspekte kommen zum Tragen. Vielleicht ist das Buch etwas zu diffus, aber es lohnt sich allemal.

  Buying this book reminded me of the need to filter/focus on the negative reviews first before buying the book to understand if it is for me or not.Although the intent of the authors is good, in trying to bring wellness to the masses, in a simple and easy way, I think it was my mistake for not being clear on what I wanted to get out of this book which is to understand better the philosophy of people who practice IKIGAI.Everything this book offers you can get from blogs and news articles.

  It is an okay book. A fast read at the very least, but to me it felt like a quick skim of general wellness practices rather than a deep dive. Some parts, for example the quick intro to yoga and taichi, felt like they were shoehorned in to fill space and offered little more info that what you might find on a Wikipedia page. I would have liked to hear more from the residents of this blue zone. All in all, it felt a little gimmicky, like it was hopping on the blue zone bandwagon that is currently all the rage. Would have been a decent long form article, but not quite enough interesting for a full book imo.

  The book touches the various aspects of life which can help us achieve a long happy life. It is based on ancient, well practised Japanese technique called‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäIKIGAI.Once you understand the meaning of the word Ikigai, the book tries to explain the deep art of staying young while growing old. It gives the references of 5 Blue Zones in the world where residents of these places live longer than average and secrets of their long life.The last section talks about collection of various different techniques which help you keep your mind and body intact.

  I‚Äôd been meaning to read this book for a while.  As it was Japanese in content but told through a western mindset.  A lot of ideas similar to the works of  Gretchen Rubin and Stephen Covey.  Even a bit of Marie Kondo‚Äôs Spark Joy philosophy.If it‚Äôs not sparking joy - make a change.The interesting link between purpose and longevity is a good one and easy enough to understand.  Living with purpose equates to less stress and longer life.10 steps to longevity in the end - Nothing striking or groundbreaking revolutionary but similar trains of thought.

  The authors seem to imply that a long, healthy life is synonymous with Ikigai; multiple chapters are spent discussing how to achieve a long, healthy life by lowering your stress, eating healthy, exercising, having meaningful relationships, ect. - things that are generally common sense. While these things are obviously important and can influence your ability to find your ikigai and remain in a peaceful state, I don't believe long life is synonymous with ikigai; the former is focused on longevity and the second on purpose. Furthermore, I would have liked more material that would actually guide readers towards thier ikigais instead of high-level overviews. The author ends with essentially saying to just follow your interests (while being healthy) and to not worry too much about finding your ikigai; I suppose the authors were suggesting to appreciate the journey rather than being fixated on the destination. Criticisms aside, there were a few good reminders in the book, and it was a short read, so I think reading this book was still a positive use of my time.

  The first 3/4th of the book was interesting and  gave good insights in how people in Okinawa live their lives. The concept of ikigai and the lifestyle attached to it is really a lesson for life.What I didnt like is the last part of the book. I had the feeling that the last part was more the thoughts of the writer and that these thoughts are 'biased' by modern literature on how to live a fullfilling life. Also the fact that there is a conclusion in the end of the book is for me a bit weird. I hoped for a more.....consistent endig of this book.Anyways, i really like the ikigai concept.

  I am a non-Japanese person who has lived in Japan for over 3 years, and was interested in this mystical concept of ""ikigai"". So, I thought I would start with this well-reviewed book.Despite it's title and introduction, this book touches very little on ikigai, and instead focuses on ""how to live a long time"" based on poorly researched information (the Daily Mirror said fruits are healthy, who knew!!!) and random, biased accounts of different forms of therapy, asian philosophy, and even *Chinese* tai-chi. The authors had the rare opportunity to gain insight into the lives of the Okinawan centenarians, but sadly only came away with little more than a few quotes about how much the elders love to garden and hang out with their friends.After reading this book, I thought I ask a real Japanese about ikigai, so I asked a native friend. I was told it is basically a lifelong hobby, passion, or profession. Sorry to burst anyone's bubble, but this is just another poorly researched and biased piece of literature romanticizing asian and ""eastern"" cultures and won't really provide you with constructive information.

  I loved the concept of IKIGAI when I first saw the diagram, and bought this book because I imagined it would help me through the process of mapping out and defining my IKIGAI. A kind of step-by-step guide to discovering my IKIGAI. It isn't that. About halfway through the book I realised it wasn't going to provide that level of insight and 'instruction', and initially felt disappointed. I stopped reading and decided to re-read the book for what it is, rather than from the perspective of what I expected it to be, and I discovered a wonderful book I definitely recommend for other seekers.It's filled with some great insights, brief introductions to other great philosophies, and a high-level overview of the 'territory' that includes IKIGAI. If you're looking for a detailed map with precise instructions on how to go from 'here' to 'there', this book is not going to be that for you. It is, instead, a very broad guide that points in the general direction of IKIGAI, and gives you some other IKIGAI-related nuggets of wisdom for consideration and inspiration.If you're feeling something tugging inside of you, this is a great place to start. If you're being pulled strongly in a specific direction and are seeking a comprehensive guide through the mist, this book may frustrate you rather than help you.

  I enjoyed reading this book full of wisdom. I would like to read further about Ikigai such as working through at an individual level, the four  areas of life that address our; Passion, Mission, Vocation and Profession and contribute towards us living a worthwhile life. These areas are identified to be; 1. What you love; 2. What the World needs; 3. What you can be paid for; 4. What you are good at.

  I put off reading this for a while as it appeared as part of the fad of ""wellbeing"" books on the shelves recently. However, I am glad I didn't pass it over. It made me cry when I realised I was on to something pure and true, of integrity and beauty. There's a great deal here to ingest, savour, contemplate - and act on.

  I really enjoy the simple and easy reading, as if I was reading the authors journals from their search about Ikigai.And this is such an important theme and I'd suggest everyone should read about it or be more conscious about it, specially if you aren't living your passion. On a side note, this goes beyond having a passion in life (something we really enjoy doing) to how we can appreciate more life.However, this books feels like a collection of notes and topics at a very surface level. This topic is important but sometimes I wish there would be a place in publishing for articles, blog posts, or concepts that could be explained in a few pages. I liked reading this book but I feel it just doesn't deliver and let's me wonder which book should I actually read if I'd like to read more about the mix of topics it talks about. The book tries to be too many things and in the end is very shallow.And if I talk about longevity, then it's really weak. At minimum anecdotical as the lists and recommendations are just weakly researched and elaborated. It's probably a good overview but not more than that. Perhaps I should read the book about the blue zones.As the authors seem to be great at writing, as I said the text is easy and engaging to read, I wished they had focused more on one topic and delivered something more substantial.It's an OK book to introduce people on the topics around ikigai. I wouldn't say the same about longevity. A lot is common sense, just the majority doesn't do it. A lot is contextual, for instance, we know that community living is important and beneficial. However, our city life development and moving to other cities makes this more and more difficult. Not to mention the demands on today's jobs and their working hours.Despite all this, it's an inspirational book and I do hope it inspires many people to find their Ikigai and create a more community living setup around them.

  The rather exotic sounding name of this book, ikigai, as the authors explain, is relatively straightforward. ‚ÄúThis Japanese concept, which translates roughly as ‚Äúthe happiness of always being busy,‚Äù is, ‚Äúlike logotherapy, but it goes a step beyond.‚Äù Logotherapy, they explain, ‚Äú‚Ä¶helps people find their purpose in life.‚ÄùIt is a good book. My overall rating of the book has little to do with the quality of the writing or the underlying concept. The former is quite good and the latter is valid. My rating is strictly personal and relates more to who might be considering adding it to their reading list. Not a ‚Äúdon‚Äôt,‚Äù for sure. More like, ‚Äúunderstand it for what it is.‚ÄùFor those who are ardent fans of all things philosophical and psychological, as I am, this is a good book that plows relatively little new ground. Finding purpose in life, keeping busy, eating well, and finding connection to the world around you is important. It‚Äôs ground, however, that has been covered by many authors over the years.If you haven‚Äôt sampled of these past triumphs you will enjoy this book very much. It is a great and easily read introduction to the topics of longevity and the benefits of living in the moment. And it chronicles many of the philosophies and prior contributions to the topic, from Buddhism to Stoicism, with a stop at the Serenity Prayer. Eastern, and particularly Japanese, contributions are given extra attention. Wabi-sabi and ichi-go ischi-e, for example, are explained in some detail, but remain an overview. Relatively newer concepts like antifragility are also explained. It even covers the Six Healing Sounds introduced by Sun Simiao in the sixth century. (This one was new to me.)A lot of the book turns on Ogimi, in the Okinawa Prefecture in Japan, which holds the distinction of being the oldest village on the planet. (In that many of the residents have lived very long lives.) It‚Äôs a delightful visit. Having lived in China for nine years and having visited Japan many times over the course of more than three decades, I have a deep fondness for places like Ogimi. I‚Äôm not sure, however, that they aren‚Äôt byproducts of the totality of Japanese culture. Could they take seed in places like California or Virginia, for example?Part of my ikigai is to be a nice person and not think disparagingly of anyone. And I am not here. This book was an interesting read for me, and may be a revelational read for you. I make no judgment on that. I just give you my experience as a reader.This book would, in my opinion, make an excellent gift for anyone in your life that might need a little boost or is otherwise hard to buy for. There is absolutely nothing here that could meet with controversy or resistance. It is decidedly upbeat throughout.And that is saying a lot of good things about any book.

  This is such a good read.  It's based on research and talks about the need to find your 'flow' in life.  I loved its advice and tips:  love what you do and do it really well, in difficult situations think about what that person has given you and what problems you have caused them, enjoy your community and friends, and spend time in the garden!  These are the useful reminders I got from this book.  It's not deep and psychological - not that there's anything wrong with that - but this is an easy to read book that oozes joy.

  To be honest, I'm not quite sure why this book has such good reviews. It's quite interesting, but it hasn't got a logical structure, and is basically a summary of different (and undoubtedly healthy) aspects of Japanese life. But while the cover implies that it really helps you find your ikigai, it gives no practical information whatsoever on how to do this, and no exercises. Therefore, after reading this book, I don't feel like I'm a step closer to finding my ikigai! Disappointing.

  Anyone interested in taking steps toward living a long and healthy life has probably already read, heard, or surmised 95% of the tips offered in this book. But the 5% that makes the difference is the part where the Ikigai comes in. Here in the west we all hear about how stress is killing us, and we‚Äôre inundated with practices and techniques to alleviate it. We‚Äôre encouraged to be ‚Äúmindful‚Äù but not much is forthcoming about how to be happy. And we don‚Äôt hear so much about purpose or finding our reason to live (Ikigai). I think anyone who is not clinically depressed or on the brink of suicide would say ‚Äúyes‚Äù if asked, ‚ÄúWould you want to live to 110 years of age in perfect health, in a state of joy, with no need for assistance with any physical or mental task?‚Äù And in this book, there are scores of interviews with people doing exactly that. Ikigai shines the spotlight on the habits, approach to, and outlook on life that are most likely responsible for not just the longevity but the vigorous and joyful longevity of the people of Okinawa - lives filled with self-sufficiency, movement, gratitude, love, peace, and antifragility.

  Based on the title and my understanding of the definition of ""ikigai"", I was expecting this book to be more about finding one's purpose or calling in life. It does mention it a little bit and makes references to Viktor Frankl's logotherapy work but otherwise didn't go into the finding purpose aspect very much. It was much more focused on how to live a long life, which should be no surprise considering that is also in the title.

  If a book easily transfers knowledge from the minds of the authors upon reading, and if that knowledge leads further to enlightenment, then it is well worth the read. This book does that.The narrative is such that the theme and concept of the book is easily understood by the reader and leads to many highlighted points worthy of memorization and meditation upon.I enjoyed the eloquent description of the faiths of Buddhism, Confucianism and Shintoism as a means to describe and not prescript upon the reader a required belief to hopefully achieve a long life. Of pertinent enjoyment was the discussion in Stocism of which the world is in need of right now.The words and explanations dug deep into my mind in that is has started to change my behavior and thought processes in a positive way.

  Beginning with an overview of Viktor Frankl and logotherapy, I was all set to love this book. Unfortunately, it never provided the in-depth analysis I was hoping for. By skipping from Frankl, to flow states, to yoga, to the importance of diet, to qi gong and tai chi, it is a book that tries to do too much and ends up being something of a mess. The analysis of Japanese philosophy and culture is very short and superficial, which is perhaps the most disappointing aspect of the book given the title's promise. Checking in at just under 200 pages, however, this book is worth skimming through as there are some great tidbits on offer.

  A clearly defined way of thinking: that's what Ikigai is about.This book offers an attractive introduction to a philosophy that has been maintained throughout centuries. Traditions define the Japanese culture, but also its practices, the day-to-day actions that guide them along the journey.Freshly written and easy to ready.

  The simple premise at the heart of this book is strong enough to carry the whole book as it settings from mental models to health to food and so on. The simple lesson is to keep chasing your heart's desire, don't retire, balance, friends and stay a little hungry and keep moving. Simple really, good read and energizing.

  So enjoyable to read ! Finding your true you and what really makes you happy . Our purpose in life all these big existential questions tackeled with such simplicity that it really makes you realize that true happiness is not that tough to reach.A beautiful concoction of the simple things that do make a difference and that do bring us consistent joy. The honest interviews of the long living person add so much to the reading. A fresh breath of air in the stressful daily life and from which we think we can t escape.
