  The book is of excellent quality, I wish all other books of paperback should be like this with affordable price.About the content in the book-All that we are is the result of what have thought. We are made of our thoughts; we are moulded by our thoughts. The above was a meaning of shloka from bhagavadgita. Buddha,swami Vivekananda are also some of great humans whose teachings tells us that the essence of human was his thoughts. THIS BOOK IS A GOOD ONE which tells us about law of attraction that repeated thoughts about what we want will create a force of attraction which attracts our goal towards us.Because our thoughts become our words, words become actions, actions become habits, habits led you to your destiny.

  The book is of very bad quality.. It seems like the seller took xerox copy (that too of bad quality) of book bought from someone who finished reading & bind it together to form a ""book"". Why because I can see the underlined portions here and there. Papers are  not even well alligned while binding. The worst part is that because of the less quality xerox there are black shades & lines everywhere.It just can ve read ignoring these coz i already have waited a really long time to get a copy because of lockdown and the only seller for english paperback is this only.So if u have any other option please go for it.

  It is the best read in the self-help genre among all the books, I have read in this genre. The book describes the law of attraction and the law of creation practically. It says that we receive what we truly want to receive from the Universe. We are what we believe we are and how we judge others. We attract everything and everyone, whether it is positive or negative. It's all about our thoughts.Highly recommend it.

The thing that I liked much about this book is believing yourself and don't limit yourself in achieving your goals.

  The author is convincing the reader very easily that the life is very simple and we are the one who complicates it. The Secret is very simple! It is in how you are connecting yourself with the Universe, the energy source - Law of Attraction! You wish, believe, attract and get it. Even though ‘The Secret’ is already exists in Indian Philosophy / Vedic Mythology, with convincing explanations and examples, Rhonda makes it  very simple to understand and makes it as one of the must read books.  This book will surely transform you amazingly!

  --- Why I like this ---A really interesting book. Helps you a lot when you feel down or tired. Its more of like a boost, Made me come back better minded. Thanks to the author.--- How long I use this---This book is never for just-read-and-throw-in-the-cupboard type. You can read it again and again all over, maybe few lines a day would do a great help. So far I've read half the book and its definitely doing the boost-up!--- How it looks---Fits just right in your hands. Reader friendly. The graphic contents (like the old page style and the text placements are eye catchy and makes it easy to read too. The content is straight to the point. It is indeed useful if you need some boosting up of your mental health after a lot of trouble-facing situations. Kudos to the authors for such a book

  A good book, but it has been hyped up way too much. Reading the book makes you feel good, positive and energetic, but the strategy in the book doesn't necessarily work. Most of the content of this book head already been written in other books before Rhonda Byrne. The only difference is that Rhonda made it sound interesting with the title, The Secret. The quality of paper is very good, but the price is quite high too. Buying and reading a paperback would be better. Do not rely on this book alone if there is something you are trying to achieve in life. You've got to work towards whatever you want to achieve and not only think positive and dream all day long.

Also go for the hardcover the quality is impeccable. The pages are so good to look and read at. I bought the hardcover for ₹241 which is a very good deal considering the quality of the print and the material used. Buy it even if it costs ₹400 it brings value worth million dollars probably more.

  Kudos to Rhonda Byrne for so nicely packing the known secret in the book""The Secret"". What the mind constantly thinks and what one focuses constantly on the thought of the mind takes shape in the form of reality. i can quote a number of instances from my own life wherein every thing happened according to what I thought it should happen. I started believing more in the 'Law of Attraction' after reading the book ""The Secret"". It is a must read for every individual if he wants to give a meaning to his life. Desire leads to thought, thought leads to action and action leads to result. We need to tune our mind to think positively all the time to avoid negative things happening.Never allow any fear or doubt entering your mind. We can lead a happy life, healthy life and prosperous life if only we program our mind to achieve the same and believe 100% on the 'power' within ourselves. This is the message given in the book ""The Secret"". After reading the book 'The Secret"" one can read another book by same author titled as 'The Magic"" to see the magic happening in real life.

  Almost everyone has heard the phrase: “It’s all in the mind,” but how many have ever tried to understand its importance and implication? I was also a part of this crowd until a few days ago, till I was gifted ‘The Secret’ by my father. This book by Rhonda Byrne changed my way of life, renewed me and taught me how to live a peaceful and contented life and be an architect of my own happiness and success. In this book, the author unveils a ‘secret’ which she claims to have been known for centuries. In the words of the author, “It has been passed down through the years, highly coveted, hidden, lost, stolen, and bought for vast sums of money.”The essence of the book is the power of our minds, which if identified and unleashed properly, can create waves of positive changes in our life. It deals with tuning our thought process which has the capability of making things happen; things that we otherwise would have never have imagined occurring. Everything that happens to us is directly or indirectly the doing of our own thoughts, which if modeled properly, can change everything in our lives. The book deals with the above mentioned theory scientifically, saying that our thoughts are magnetic and a frequency is associated with each one of them and when they are sent out into the universe, they attract like objects which are reflected back to us. In short, our thoughts become things.This book answers questions like why are we asked to culture good and healthy feelings right from our childhood. As a matter of fact, these are the things that decide the course our lives take. The importance and need of feelings and emotions, the need to sometimes give in to things that our hearts desire for, the need to prematurely ‘feel’ the things we want to happen, the need to take good care of our health, the need to treat ourselves with love and respect, the ways to make our relationships with others work, the need and ways of expressing our gratitude to the Maker as well as everyone and everything that have touched our lives – all these have been discussed intricately in a detailed manner in the book.

  Very nice book, motivating and uplifting. At the same time, it lacks substance. For example, we have extreme poverty in the world. Even a country like America has poverty. Should the secret be used to accumulate only individual wealth? Why can’t the author and all the great people listed in the book stand together and eradicate poverty in America? I live in a much more worse country. In India, where I live, the roads have potholes. Is it possible for me to use the Secret to remove potholes from all roads in India? Well, these are some of the questions I have. And the book does not answer these questions.

  Quality of pages are quite disappointing. It's not original. It is like the one which is sold on footpath in 100 bucks. So it's a bad deal. Moreover when I requested return, return was not picked up.  we need to courier it ourself. That should be mentioned while time of purchase.Purchasing of this book is total waste of money. Please buy from outlet else this type of quality can be bought in 100 bucks from railway stations and road side market.

  First of all, the presentation of this book, from every perspective imaginable is impeccable. The fonts, the overall quality, just wow. You will feel a whole new experience from the starting chapter. With quotes and examples, it just becomes more interesting. The only factor I found weird is that after initial few chapters, the reader can feel a tinge of repetition... Everywhere... In ideas, types of examples. This makes the interest to slowly slip away as you proceed. Overall it's an average purchase. You won't regret buying it. The catch is... Won't applaud it either...

Never mind the book is in good condition and the feel of the book gives the reader to read more. I saw the movie and it was great and it's the same with the book. Cheers and thank you because I will get 10000000rs /- in this year I don't know how but I believe I will get it😉

  It's like old wine in New bottle. The book is compiled really well. But whatever is said by Ms. Rhonda Byrne, it's already been told by our Sages 5000 yrs ago. It's only the compilation job she has done, not the actual writing. Full marks to narration and compilation.

  Rhonda byrne very well took the topic and tried to give a live examples from the people who have actually experienced and gained benefits from the book. The book clearly talks about how u should be feel gratitude for everything you have. How you should be thankful for each day. The way this book talks how words coming out from our mouth has meaning and how our cosmos and our life gets reflectedIt makes you the supreme and very effectively speaks how we are masters of our own destiny and we create our own fateIt's a very nice therapy and very helpful for people to regain their confidence proud of themselves and also a secret to live.""Live life love life""

  I have started reading this book at least 7 times.  However I just couldn't go beyond the first chapter.  I stop and then pick it up again a few months later and each time I get the same feeling.  The book is rather cheesy... Every time I start reading, it reminds me of late night telemarketing commercials...I just can't get the hype.  The idea is not original and there are a million other books so much better than this, that explains the law of attraction in a much classier way.I would rather ""watch"" the movie (which is equally trashy)... But I can fast forward and finish in 10 minutes and still get what the author was trying to say.(Hopefully one of these days I will muster up the courage to finish this painfully boring book and if at all my opinion changes, I will update my review)

  I am writing this review after more than a year of practice in law of attraction. I read this book first time in 2014. The best and the only book I have ever read completely with interest. Read it for every 3 months as a practice for few years may be a 2 or 3 years. See the magic in your thoughts and thinking after years. See it's quit obvious that secret won't work If I dream to reach mars and waiting for the secret to work. Believe me too: The secret will work for sure. Don't ask me how but It will work magically. It worked for me all the time if you are a realistic person. I dreamed and felt like I was driving Elite I20 from the day it launched, Finally I got elite I20 only after thinking lot of possibilities like Baleno, swift, Jazz, Figo etc. Even I booked Baleno and waited for 4 months but finally cancelled and took I20 only. Now don't ask me how it worked :) Lot of examples in my life like this.. Everything will work. Trust in yourself, you can do anything and everything - Swami Vivekananda.Pros:1) Your way of thinking will completely change after reading this book2) You will be in boosted mood with full positive thinking3) Really it works for most of the times. The secret worked for me most of the times.4) The fact and you feel that there is really someone connected through your thoughts and making your wishes come true.5) You will see completely new version of you after reading this book.

  Well I ordered The Secret from Amaon, delivery service was highly problematic so I cancelled the order. And purchased a copy of it from a book stall in Delhi. Its amazing. Anyone can change is his / her destiny if he / she is willing enough to change the self. I was decent kid, but sadly not grown up in a very good home. Unfortunately something happened to 4/5 years back. Bitter memories from childhood and that particular incident made me less than a human. My behavior suddenly turned upside down. I suffered losses in every sphere, because i started ignoring most of the situations. But after reading The secret, now I know if you want to live happily you negate the negatives and invite positives in your life. I am a changed man today or you can say I am regaining my same moral and attitude that was years ago. Thanks to Rhonda Byrne.

  Its one of the wonderful power that human beings are having. I knew about this power when i was young and been using it for so many years and having fun with the friends but was not aware what exact procedure to be followed. After searching lot about the power, i have came across the Book and movie,THE SECRET. After going briefly with the procedure. Am able to follow it clearly.One of the best thing about the author is that they have created the movie of The Secret, that helps in understanding it properly and has helped how to use the power within us.

  The Secret is a self-help book by the Australian author Rhonda Byrne trying to explain how your thoughts are the driving force of your life. This wasn’t a book that I couldn’t avoid for too long for I always found this book in large numbers in bookstores; not just in English but in a lot of other languages which naturally kindled my curiosity as to what was so special about this and also the fact that the same was ceaselessly suggested by some of my friends.The book starts with revealing The Secret which I believe is the law of attraction proposed in this book, that is, you attract what you think and your life is crafted by your thoughts. It the sequentially mentions how this law could be used for wealth, relationships, health, weight reduction, etc.I liked it as to how the book is trying to trigger positive thinking for that is something I lack; in the sense that I think of all the possibilities and under the doctrine of being prepared for the worst, I more often than not, think only about the worst possible outcome and I guess I would use some of what the book has said to ensure a balance. The book also endorsed one of the strongest philosophies that I believe in; something which I liked (which is not agreed upon in most supposed spiritual books); that you’re the master of your own fate / destiny. I also liked the way in which the book was presented; each discussion being split into various chapters and then, at the end of each, you had a summary of what was stated in each of these chapters. The book was also concise considering the whole message was delivered in around 200 pages meaning that you don’t have to be a voracious reader in order to complete this book.However, my problem with this book, predictably, was the excessive justification through pseudoscience; for one, comparing this law of attraction on a par with the law of gravity is outrageous to being with and two, some outrageous claims were made by the author where she stated that even though she didn’t study physics, by sheer thoughts, she perfectly understands quantum physics today; a topic which most physicists have struggled to crack with this popular quote from the physicist Richard Feynman – ‘If you think you understand quantum mechanics, you don't understand quantum mechanics.’ Moreover, I believed that this book could be taken to induce positive thinking on the topics but then; her tips on topics such as health or financial management or dieting should be straightaway dismissed.I always like reading on topics which I don’t ideologically agree with such as metaphysics, in this case and to be honest, I had a good time reading this book and some of the author’s suggestions were good which I could possibly implement and of course, predictably, I was totally outraged by some of her comparisons and analogies which I have touched upon previously. To conclude, I would say that this is a reasonable book with some practical solutions and a lot of codswallop. On the whole, I would award the book a rating of three.

  A must-read for everyone who wants to lead a life full of vibrancy, optimism, love and magic. I strongly recommend that you carry a copy of this book with you always. Every word in the book is like a precious gem. It highlights, albeit in a gentle fashion, the pitfalls of a routine and monotonous life and how we can all change that by changing the radio frequency of our thoughts. We just need to change the frequency! The Good angels are all there to protect you, to help you, to rediscover yourself.... you only need to call them and they will be there to take care of you...Remember to remember... Everyone has the power to change what destiny has in store for them... but remember to remember that you have the power. Be aware of the power that you possess. Change the lens with which you have always looked at the world and now you will see a world full of love, life and magic. The significant take away from this book is that - YOU MUST LOVE YOURSELF & NEVER STOP THANKING THE ALMIGHTY AND THE ANGELS....It is a great healer....This is the perfect book for dealing with the vicissitudes of life in today's stressful times.

  Have you ever wondered how the great personalities like Albert Einstein, Henry Ford, Michaelangelo have succeeded in their respective roles ? How did they overcome their trepidations, suspicions and worries ? What made them enormously believe in their power to make a good change to this world ? Have they also faced the dauntingly gruesome repulsion from their peers and if yes, how did they manage to keep their sanity alive ? All the above questions continuously bugged my mind and i am sure it does the same to you. The Secret by Rhonda Byrne talks about the very factor in complete detail. In this book, the author restated the secret behind getting exceptional in any area. The secret to life, the secret to wealth, the secret to relationship etcetera has been elaborated in different chapters.Author explained firmly  that Universe would grant you everything you wish for provided you have it clear in your mind. It goes well with the saying that vague goals leads to vague results. In order to turn your dreams into reality, there's a three step procedure that needs to be followed sincerely. It begins with 'ask' which indicates that one needs to ask whatever one aims for. The Universe would not understand unless you made it so. The second being 'believe', that means you need to have utter belief that you are going to get what you asked for. And last one being 'feel' describes that one should start feeling the way one would on getting what they aspires for. According to Rhonda, a person should start experiencing the ultimate joy before actually having it.  By gaining absolute surety, there is nothing which could stop a man from reaching to this final destination.Talking about the book wholesomely, it was a good read backed by various statements by renowned motivators and teachers like Jack Canfield. The only thing which i didn't like much is the lack of examples in the book. Though every text was powerful enough to boost one's confidence, nonetheless i somewhere felt the absence of practical approach. The whole book was filled with quotations, texts and principles. Seldom did i find any success story or example to back these rules. It would have been much better and less tedious if author had tried working on that part too.

  Aahmmm... A very criticized bookMany people say that this is not truth this is not reality and they are sure that things don't go this way and universe doesn't works like this but have you ever been sad and thought that there should be one thing which brings a smile on your face and makes you happy brings hope... Silver Line in black cloud is shown buy this book this book points to the happiness in the darkest of days it helps in making the person smile the one who is very sad and depressed it is very true that without working you won't get anything but how will you work if you are not motivated not inspired and see no hope when we are at the brink of the end then only a single pose is what which makes a person successful or... this book will surely bring hope to someone who is that and think that he is not capable of being this is surely in my point of you are not a self development book it's a motivational book a self help book but it still you will see some cream part of many of those books which are written on being successful.....

  Please See attached pics .This is a class book on the law of attraction.  If you are unsure about buying the book, you can watch the movie ""The secret"" and then decide if want to keep a book as a reminder of the principles showcased in the movie. The movie is more powerful than the book, in transforming your belief in the principle of attraction.The book is so beautiful in content as well as quality of printing. All the pages are glossy and in colour. Its a hardback with a gorgeous jacket.Its so well made that you cant help byt pick it up everytine you see it and just flip through it.I cannot believe i purchased this beautiful edition for just 215 INR on amazon india,  I had read this book many years ago, finally decided own a personal copy because of the Fabulous doscount. I wouldnt have bought it without this discount, Definitely not worth the original MRP of 750.

  Not really useful. Aims to brainwash the reader with flights of fanciful imagination, without sufficient relevance to self-introspection, efforts and goals.

  Just think that youll be rich, and you will be. The universe will... Yeah, not really. This book is one of those 'wonder' products that seemingly solve everything. Anyone who 'believes' in irrational things is either misinformed or delusional. Do yourself a favor, dont read such books, and life will be somewhat worth living. The universe does not conspire to give you everything you want. This book contradicts every piece of proven scientific research and evidence. It is insulting to an intellectual like me. But, the book seems to be selling, so hey, the universe has conspired to make this author rich!! :) /sarcasm/

  It is said that you should never have high hope about anything. We are human beings, not programmed machines, and hence forget this very logic many a time. Resulting in a broken hope and a dull day.That exactly was my condition after reading “The Secret.”Stop reading this blog post at this point, if you intend to read the book. I am going to reveal the “secret” from “The Secret.”As you have decided to continue reading, here you go. Do you want to become famous?Think, feel, of becoming famous. You feel it as if you already have become famous. Act as though everyone around and media (both national and international) is speaking about you. Feel it. Believe it. Realize it.Bingo!You have become famous. The “law of attraction” will make you famous.Do you want to become a millionaire?Think, feel, of becoming rich. You feel it as if you already have billions of money in our bank account. Feel it. Believe it. Realize it.Bingo!You have become famous. The “law of attraction” will make you rich.Do you want to achieve something?Think, feel, of becoming achieving that particular thing. Feel it. Believe it. Realize it.Bingo!You have achieved that unachievable thing. The “law of attraction” will make achieve it.This is what is said in the 198 page long book. One thing, “the law of attraction” is repeated in every other sentence. As though you sit dreaming about it and everything will happen by itself.I am neither saying the theory is wrong, nor apprehensive about the power of subconscious mind. On the other hand, I am a firm believer of the power this universe possesses. Of course, it can “make” things happen.I am of the opinion that “if we don’t know or believe about a thing, doesn’t mean that the particular things does not exist. But we have not yet developed the apparatus to identify or prove the existence/ non-existence of that particular thing.”Forget about the universe, we have not yet made any progress in studies with respect to our own “unconscious mind,” and has not fully understood “subconscious mind,” which are presumably inside us.I am not denying anything said in the book. But, the way things are described in the book are too boring to read. Repeating same sentences until you feel sleepy, until you start asking yourself, “What’s the requirement of 198 pages to repeat the same thing?”It was too tedious a task for me to complete the book.Maybe Oprah Winfrey show was the real reason for the huge sale of the book, not the quality. The thought, “how can I say the book is bad, if a personality like Oprah Winfrey is endorsing it?” may be the reason for the sale of the book.Or perhaps the real reason is “Law of Attraction.”I am not recommending it.By the way, who am I to recommend, once Oprah had recommended it?Pros:  Timely delivery by Amazon.Cons:  Too monotonous.

  I don't why this book was so hyped. You should try reading power of subconscious mind. It's pretty amazing.This books blames you for whatever is happening in your life. It tells you that whatever is happening good or bad is because you have attracted it. That's pretty stupid. Nobody wants bad things to happen to them. Yes people worry but that doesn't mean that all the bad things happen to those people who worry and not to those who doesn't worry.

  Rating : 5/5I read the book by curiosity. The book has no story, nor even any true words based on our daily life . But the book attracted me by its positive sentences. If you read at a glance you might think , that the words of this book are utmost unbelievable , but if you give it a think it works. It works as a mental game, it gives you the positive energy to face any challenges without fear. The Secret is amazing and if one somehow managed to fuse these thoughts into regular day to day existence it would in reality be a relentless power. The fact of the matter is self-evident; in case you're feeling cheerful you are thinking glad contemplation. What is energizing is to understand that one can utilize one's emotions to comprehend what one is thinking. Further, one can utilize ones all the more promptly controllable musings to influence ones sentiments.The Secret instructs us to see today, make tomorrow, however enable the universe to decidedly impact us as we anticipate positive vitality. You realize where you're going, however you can just observe 200 ft before you. Life must be taken as it comes however we can give it course. You should remain on track, yet bargain, decidedly, with the knocks that go along the way. We should be grateful for all that is exhibited to us since it characterizes us.The book proceeds to apply the idea of inspiration to well-being, connections, bounty, appreciation, and at last life. Surely the fact is to be glad presently, feel great at this point.Some of my points I jot down from this book :• Nothing can come into your experience unless you summon it thought consistently.• Careful, the thoughts of doubt are powerful too.• Imagination is everything. It is the preview of life’s coming attractions• Use Vision boards as ways to visualize your goals• What you believe it will start happening. So believe strong and positive• You’re getting exactly what you’re feeling about, not so much what you’re thinking about• Dont doubt or question on your believe just start implementing your thoughts into a positive direction“Take the first step in faith. You don’t have to see the whole staircase, just take the first step” – Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.“All that we are is a result of what we have thought” – Buddha

  “The Secret” by Rhonda Byrne is a self-help book, persistently advocates the superior power of positive thinking. I was dubious about this one whether it like ordinary self-help books that talk about irrational ideas to espouse in life. But it turned out to be a remarkably fascinating and rational one.The book has eloquently explained the power of positive thinking with the aid of several examples. It provides ways to enhance positive thinking as well. The author claims the scientific basis of the ideas that is precisely the “Law of Attraction”, which sounds genuine.You will get knowing how positive thinking creates a whole new world according to your desires and its impact on one’s relationship, wealth, health, and life.I read this book when I had been dealing with some unfortunate situation in my life. Thankfully, it aided me somewhat to get over that circumstance.It is a thin book with excellent contents. At some point, this book sounds a bit monotonous. The primary idea of this book is :“You are the one who calls the law of attraction into action, and you do it through your thoughts.”― Rhonda Byrne, The SecretI would recommend this book to everyone which will help you to discover your inner strength.  STAY POSITIVE.

  THE SECRET is a masterpiece, a powerful book that each one should read.It provides secrets to success, love, power, joy, health and all that we desire to live with in life.The book will tell you that the universe conspires in your favour, your energies, thoughts and actions attract what you wish for. This ideology is supported by many examples to bring clarity and make the secret easy and applicable to anyone and everyone.The mind is powerful and so is the action that one performs leading to success or failure in life.Self discovery is a continuous process and with utmost dedication and observation one can find the true purpose or fulfil an ardent wish if one believes in oneself.Not one but multiple instances are mentioned by different teachers, authors, filmmakers and various others which make it an interesting read.The book is unusual and impactful and it's not a regular self help book. It's one of its kind and proves to be a great investment if it's secrets are put to use in life.My suggestion is to go slow and ponder over all that's happening with you while you read it make use of all that it teaches and be the best of what you aspire to become in life. Its all about the journey the destination will arrive eventually, make the journey worth the while.😊 Highly recommended!Rating: 4/5

  FIVE STAR RATING FOR THE BOOK. It's REALLY AMAZING. I had read this book after borrowing it from my friend and it was such an amazing one that I HAD to get one for myself.I was searching for a good deal, found it on Amazon and ordered it.However, I have been sold a FAKE PIRATED BOOK by the seller. I have attached images. The book is similar to those pirated books sold on the street sides. Absolutely disgusted with it.Pages have toner ink on them, images are all blurred out, low quality paper, words running right till the edge of the page.IT IS ILLEGAL TO SELL PIRATED BOOKS and I wonder if Amazon WILL wake up from its slumber and take action against the seller.

  General detailsAuthor: Rhonda ByrneGenre: Self helpPublished: 26 November 2006Publisher: Simon & Schuster UK LtdPages:197My review :By every turn of page it seems like everything that happened in your life makes sense, all the pieces have been put together , you have found divinity. But, no……….This is a very manipulative book. It tells you to think of the good and good shall come to you(fine till here)You should not talk about the bad things happening with you when somebody asks,”how are you?” , You should think about you and only you. Every secret was linked to one materialistic thing WEALTH. It was about how to welcome wealth, thesecret.tv uploaded a magic cheque but what about a magic report card?It tells you if you think bad, you have negative thoughts, the bad will come to you. Your thoughts attract alike thoughts. Your present is the result of your past thoughts. If you get robbed ,raped, killed,born in poverty, it is because you welcomed it, you are at fault. How does it justify how a 3 year old child getting raped? An infant getting killed after birth? The holocaust?Yes, I must say I liked the “law of attraction” but this book tells you to live in illusion and be ignorant. keep on daydreaming and you shall have everything . Be self obsessed , think for yourself you and only you and everything around will fall into place, it tells you to think of the happy places and ignore the rest. It says if you want to achieve your ideal weight , imagine yourself that way and “do not look at a fat person”(quoted).This book will hypnotize you. It will make believe that your life’s going to change completely. You will rule the world. But, dear dear, don’t be misled by it. Under the possession of this book’s spell , I started following the secret and I was on the verge of insanity.It was Rhonda Byrne’s secret to Endless prosperity.My Rating: ⭐⭐⭐/53 stars just because of the writing skill.RecommendationI would never recommend anyone to read it.

  This book is an example of how to tap into weak minds to get a good set of generic thoughts as something universal. Don't waste your money, this is for those who have lost their own ability and wants some hope and make believe reading. I don't understand how a very wooly and philosophically weak writing such as this has helped hundreds. It is such a mockery of universal energy and the preponderance of thoughts such as universe will conspire and work towards what you ask for is simply a placebo worse than a homeopathy medicine. If it has helped people it is only because of the wrong hope this book has managed to create and spread.

  Let us say you have X dollar in your bank account and you don't remember, exactly how much it is. Now you want Y amount but you are not writing a cheque fearing that it might get bounce. So law of attraction makes you imagine that you already have Y amount in your bank account and inspires you to write cheque. In reality, if Y is smaller than X then you will get the money and you will think that law of attraction worked. But in reality, if Y is bigger than X then you will not get the money and law of attraction will inspire you to work hard, increase money in your account and again write cheque. This time you have increased X so chances of your cheque getting encash has increased. In this way every next time you write a cheque, your chance of getting it encashed is increased and finally it reaches to 100%. The underlying principle here is not your imagination (law of attraction) but your actions (law of Karma). Your imagination has just motivated you to do actions - be it writing a cheque or working and increasing balance in your bank account.Another example is when you want to loose weight. For this law of attraction tells that you imagine yourself with perfect weight and you will see universe giving you lot of opportunities to actually loose the weight by showing you gym on your way, diet show on your favorite TV channel, etc. But in reality gym and diet show were already there, you just started to notice them in conscious mind, earlier they were sent to your subconscious mind. Here the action which produced consequent reaction was your continuous thinking and not the universe as suggested by law of attraction.Law of attraction is incomplete because it does not explain that one has to deserve and qualify himself to get what he wants. In fact, law of attraction is dangerous idea because:1) It may lead people trying to achieve impossible and put them in depression. For example, trying to change what's already happened or said in the past. You can't go back in time and fix it even if you strongly imagine yourself doing it or saying it right for rest of your life. Another dangerous thing that law of attraction has encouraged is today's youth trying to fix the impossible relationships. After studying law of attraction most of the youth apply it in first place, is to build relationship with opposite gender. In reality, they end up wasting their valuable time trying to realize their whimsical likes and not putting their energy in anything substantial. In case, boy or girl builds a relationship after lot of imagination and efforts, he or she is most likely to end it in due course because of completely different attitude, thinking and psychology of opposite person. Experts say that 85% relationships end in bitter, depressing and painful breakups [1]. Law of attraction encourages the idea that nothing is impossible and people love this idea. But in reality certain things are impossible. For example, only one person can top an entrance exam, even if 100 participants are applying law of attraction and imagining themselves topper. It's just not possible. Law of attraction binds a person to something, not allowing him to move ahead when he don't deserve it or it's not good for him.2) It makes people impatient. It may lead one to simply waste time imagining something and not giving sufficient time to work for it. No overnight success happens over a night. Any successful person will ascertain to this. But follower of law of attraction will  spend time visualizing his success everyday. And it puts him into depression or frustration at the end of 21 day or six months, when he don't really get it.3) It makes a person a plaything in the hands of three evils: Desire, Anger and Greed. Law of attraction inspires a person for more and more desires rather than living a simple and satisfied life. When a person is not able to fulfill his desire, he becomes victim of anger and frustration with life. And when his desire is fulfilled, he'll become victim of greed to achieve even more. Also the sense of success of law of attraction will lead a person to make newer and newer desires, never allowing him to be at ease with life.  It makes person forget that one day he has to give up everything he has gathered - be it fame, wealth, relationships or anything.

  A beautiful book . Very very promising. I loved it , but let me tell you , learning the 'law of attraction' and practicing it in your daily life is gonna take some time. You've gotta continue to remember the important points and practise them in your daily life probably , almost every day.So , read it slowly and over a period of time finish reading the book. Dont read it like a novel , in hurry. Dont try to just finish reading it in 2-3 days. Read it page by page, and highlight the page numbers which carry an important message/tip for life. So , if you want to go back to the book after a year, you can just refer to the pages that you marked instead of reading the whole book again.But a great job by the author.It really gives us the feeling that we truly behold the future in our hands, and that he who conquers his mind is going to win. It can be life changing if you put it to use.

  I never knew a book had the power to change the way a person thinks. It is a book that teaches you to think in the right direction without being preachy! I am not fond of philosophical books, thought it was going to be a very boring book. To my surprise I was  bowled over right from the first page. It has totally change my perception of positive thinking. Life has started looking more hopeful and beautiful.I would term this the modern day Ramayana. I have heard people mentioning that whenever you need an answer for any question, just open a random page in Ramayana and you would find your answer. The Secret is the same too. The minute you read a page you feel so positive and think your life is in your control.Clearly understand what you want and start believing it. It is time for me to see how my life changes!

  This book has changed so many lives and it has also changed mine. But like Bob Proctor says in his other seminars, This book won't help unless you really need it. I saw it many years and it didn't effect me. I didn't need it at that time. Later i was struggling with life and there was a time i was leading towards depression when i started watching the documentary. I read the book later. But it instantly hit me what i was doing wrong in my life. I knew they were right but i needed more proofs so i started reading every book that talked about the same concept and i have never stopped reading since. It can change your life too but you need to trust it that it will. Don't discard it before testing it once.

  Highly over hyped book. The author has copied the concept and represented the copied idea in a vague manner. Why this act of plagiarism is appreciated so much?Many good books were available well before the publication of this book which describe law of attraction in detail and in a perfect manner. For example, The master key system by Charles Haanel, published more than hundred years ago, describes this concept so precisely that you feel the change inside you while reading the book.This book by Rhonda is very cheap. If you have read really good books dealing with the same concept, you will find 'The secret by Rhonda Byrne' very irritating and annoying.

  Got this as a gift and listed below are my reasons for the poor rating :1. Now, self help books are difficult to review because they are the least objective books, as in, unlike fiction or history its more like medicine....if it suits you well and good but if it doesnt then you've just wasted your time and money. Since I never purchased this book I did not feel the pinch of losing money, but yes, I did not find/ discover any secret from this book after multiple patient readings.2. If you want something the entire universe conspires you to get that thing is an old wine in new bottle thing. And personally it is the least motivating message. If you want something then you get it by hardwork but if you still dont you have to leave it there. Thats it. I mean can all of us really get whatever we desire??? May be yes. But maybe. So the bottom line is you have to look for the silver lining yourself. This book will not give you any extra gyaan.3. Self help books are mainly helping the authors who write such books( they get rich!!! whoa!!!). Not that I have anything against them but they manage to market themselves in such a way that you may tend to idolize and live by your self help guru. One saying or few sayings cannot describe the tumultuous journey of mankind. Something called a greater force prevails and one cannot change the course of one's destiny entirely. So even the most optimistic human braves a low point in his/her life. And he needs to work towards overcoming that. One may find inspiration in such books but really, you need more than words and imagination to help you in your bad times.4. YOU CANNOT REVERSE AGING. FULL STOP! Ms Byrne says you can! LOL!!!Finally, yes such books help a lot of people but cant kind words and gentle suggestions work? Why would I promote a self help book, I'd rather prefer being around someone who needs help.

  Prominent coincidences modify the brain to a greater extent than the not-so-prominent failures of the 'law of attraction', a concept the book showcases as the secret. I could imagine a work problem to get resolved by the end of the week. I could really visualise the resolve and myself enjoying the weekend with nothing to worry about. I could concentrate and truly believe it will happen. Come Friday, if the problem doesn't get resolved by itself, it won't surprise me all that much. I might not even realise that the law of attraction didn't work in this particular case. If the problem does get resolved however, it would be a prominent event for the brain, which would modify itself to believe that this methodology is linked to success of achieving things. Out of a hundred different things I try to attract using the law of attraction, even if I get a handful just out of sheer chance, my brain would modify itself to believe this actually works. This trickery is nothing new though. It's just a variation of prayers, rituals, thought controls, and really many other zero correlation activities. This is not to say that the trickery is itself intended by the trickster. It could well be that even the trickster is tricked into believing into this and does not have a good understanding of the brain. Even scientists make errors of accepting false hypotheses. This is known as a Type 1 error in Statistics. Conspiracy theories find shelter in the brain and gamblers find patterns in outcomes. Our brains have not evolved to see the world as it is. They have evolved to see the world as it is useful. Information by itself is useless. It is how the information is interpreted that matters. We need our brains to be able to seek out patterns and make sense of reality, even at the cost of making false conclusions. This unfortunately sometimes overlaps into the harmful more than the useful. Believing in superstitions, bogus laws of attraction, ultimate justice, sinful birth, rituals, etc have been extremely harmful to society. They have been a major friction to progress and knowledge. They distort reality and keep you from tackling problems the direct way. Entire industries like homeopathy and acupuncture have been set around it that give people false hope for recovery, and nothing more than a placebo effect at times. It diverts resources away from the proper methodology of solving problems and directs them toward meaningless activities based on wishful thinking.

  The Secret is  kind of a motivational book... But sometimes the logics of the writer becomes unbelievable. Like when the writer says ' You just have to think about it and you will get it' But it's not that easy!!! The author doesn't say anything about working hard . Its just about optism. But still at times this book becomes hard to believe. If you are looking for a good motivational book I would suggest to go for 8 TO BE GREAT . This book is just not worth buying..

  Concept shared is intuitive, simple and relatable. The concept appeared to me in nutshell being confident in doing the right thing and things will fall in place which has been shared in different words. What I felt was a big lack was over and over repetition of same thing again and again!! This could have been made may be more believable with factual details. The theory is fine and examples are also shared in bits and pieces but I felt while the core was present; the peripherals could have been worked upon.

  All my life I have struggled to hold a job, keep a woman and to gain friendships.  I have autism and so I was an easy target for bullies of both genders not just at school, but also in the Workplace.  I simply did not fit in and still don't fit in anywhere.So I got this book and now I am trying to apply what it says to my life.  I don't want millions of pounds or anything fancy, but I do want what everyone else has a loving Wife, Car, and Home to call my own.These I believe by the scope of this book are achievable and realistic goals that I am setting myself.  So it remains to be seen if this book truly can do what it says it can.After reading a couple of chapters so far all I can see is a brilliant book to teach you how to feel good in yourself.  To make yourself feel happy even when sad and depressed.  That alone is worth more than any amount of millions.  There are plenty of millionaires that are not happy at all and struggled to make more millions which in turn makes them just as miserable.This book teaches you how to look at your emotions and thoughts and feelings and change your thinking to a better place.  If you are looking for a load of quick results then don't bother.  This book will teach you how to make yourself feel good about yourself and in turn, attract good things to you, but remember good things come to those who wait.  If you cant then you won't get.As books go this is old news now, but I got it for 6 pounds second hand, hardback and in good condition.  For me, it is not worth the 14 pounds brand new price, but each to their own.  There are many different books since using the same techniques, but with clearer examples.If you expect to become a rich person after this book, then you may become one, but remember as the book says you need to really believe you already have the money and already are rich.I will update this if my life changes and I do get a job and get a nice woman in my life.  I will update this if I do get that house and what every average person has.  I will not set a time limit, but as I reach my goals I will update this review.

  The book is very basic.Is a continuous repetition that if you think good, good will come to you.The concept is fine.What is worrying is that the author has the cheek to say that everything that happens to people in life is a consequence of their own thoughts, without considering social-economical situations of the subjects. So if  a child is hit by a  bomb in a war country  that means the child has been sending out to the university this idea ? And his mother is guilty of thinking the same for her child and so her suffering is a consequence of her thoughts?I worked in a casino, I know how bad addicts wish to be millionairse and pray and continuously think about winning ? Do they win ? Nope more like ending selling their wife's jewellery !This book avoids the concept of PURE INTENTIONS- EGO and KARMA.Avoid

  So there are many negative reviews about this book. It may be a load of rubbish but it's a load rubbish because you believe it is. Growing up parents, teachers and other elders told us that the positive or negative in an object or a person is how we see it or them. It's what we believe to be true. So having read this, if you think it's not effective or ""a load of rubbish"" well that's your belief and that's what you will get out of it. That's the law of attraction, if you believe this book wont to help you well that is what you will get. Vice versa!

  While positive thinking and believing in yourself/health/happiness/goals/and dreams are indeed important, I was thoroughly irritated by this book. To sum it all up it’s focuses on “thinking” about something consistently and passionately enough to bring that desired thing into fruition.

  Die Grundidee ""positive Denken"" ist löblich.Aber zu behaupten man kann die Realität verändern (z.b. seine eigene Krebserkrankung heilen, eine Beziehung kitten, ein besserer Job) indem man nur intensiv genug an den Wunsch denkt und seine Gedanken dem Wunsch gegenüber positiv einstellt (und so das positive Ergebnis kosmisch anzieht), ist extrem gefährlich.Das Buch hat ebensogenau eine mögliche Erklärung warum es nicht geklappt hat: Das eigene Denken war nicht positiv genug. Damit liegt das ""warum es nicht geklappt hat"" genau und exakt bei sich:- An Krebs gestorben weil Therapie abgebrochen und positiv gedacht... Nicht genug positiv gedacht.- Beziehung gescheitert - Nur dein Fehler... Nicht genug positiv gedacht.- Arbeitslos geworden - Nur dein Fehler... Nicht genug positiv gedacht.Ich empfehle vorher die Lektüre von Psiram zum Thema.

  It might help you to get out of depression for month or two if you choose to believe. It shows lots of examples of people who put lots of work and energy, some of them lifetime in their work and still they couldn't believe in the work they done.., but then they discovered Law of attraction and things changed.

  I saw The Secret film not long after it first came out and remember its viral success and how much it influenced so many people. I think because of the popularity of it many people are overly critical of the film and book. I only ever take what works for me from anyone's point of view. I put off buying the book partly because I thought it would just be like the film, which is not true.I actually much prefer the book and feel it provides a more practical and in-depth approach. It fills in lots of missing info and presents a more realistic approach. It's a modern classic in the world or manifesting and the law of attraction. I will definitely look out for her other books.

  This tiny book has has a good quality cover, brown design imitating the ancient scrolls and a promise to shed some light on what is the most important thing you can do in your life.  The most important thing is to start  thinking about what you want rather than what you don't want. It is a starting point and thinking  does not become more than a wishful thinking unless you take it to the practical level.And that is - get out of the way of anyone who challenges you because you are not entitled on your own opinion. Do not fight against anything or anyone. If you  have opposition that conflicts with your desires it is negative and therefore it is not real. This sort of thinking can push you into dreaming and getting out of touch with the reality.Blame yourself first, not anything or anyone because it leads to negative thoughts about the world. You only can have positive thoughts while negative ones are not real. Do not judge. Do not resist anything.While it is truth that you can achieve more with the positive attitude, the thoughts alone and ignorance of the material reality is a way too far form the realisation of your wishes. Confirm to the  idea that everything is fine no matter what problems take place in your real life. It sounds too good and too simple.The book is for the followers of the spiritual fantasies ignoring the real material world, not for leaders or authorities.The author is nighter a therapist, a prophet or an expert in career development but certainly communicates well her ideas .  Is this the wisdom?

  This book in a nutshell: ""Focus on what you want. Don't focus on what you don't want or that's what you'll get"".  I'm probably a text-book over thinker and I find this book is a really helpful way to re-adjust my mind to think positively when I find myself thinking I can't do something, I will never get this or that etc.  Just read a few pages and I'm back thinking anything is possible!

  I cannot recommend these books enough. The 1st is like “Here is what you can have!” The 2nd is “This is how to do it.” The 3rd is “Here’s a fool proof step by step guide”. They have changed me so much for the better. Almost nothing phases me now, I’m 95% positive all the time and I’m grateful for everything.  I’m handling the worst situations with ease and I’m inundated with positive opportunities daily. It’s weird! It works!!! I ask for want I want/need and I get it. I started reading them 6 months ago and have already got 8 out of the 10 things on my ‘wants’ list.

  The essence of the book, i.e. the power of positive thinking is something I understand; however, the repetition of sometimes the same sentences over and over and over throughout the book could have been edited from 184 pages to a max. of 20. I kept reading it until towards the end when on page 172 I decided enough was enough!""If you are seeing an answer or guidance on something in your life, ask the question, believe you will receive, and then open this book randomly. At the exact place where the pages fall open will be the guidance and answer you are seeking.""Seriously?!!!

  Really basic message about positive thoughts and nothing really insightful. Written in a style with lots and lots of quotes rather than academic narrative. The writer comes across as very poor in literary skills and uses other people’s knowledge in quotes. Some of the connections she makes to historic events  and famous people are suspect, not sure if they are factually correct.  Good, easy read if you need a ‘pick-me-up’. Overpriced for what it is.

  I agree with previous reviews, the book is repetitive and full of useless quotes from ‘experts’ on how thinking good, positive thoughts attracts everything you want to you. I get thinking positively and the effect it can have on your mood, I get visualizing the result you want as it can help motivate you and help you see the necessary steps. But saying you get what you think about is just creating a self-fulfilling prophecy, and as someone else mentioned the book does victim blame – ‘you got ill because you were not thinking good thoughts about your health’.

  I've read it and it does provide some good points on life and how positivty can change your life for the best. However, I do not entirely agree with everything under the so called ""secret to life"" and feels like it's written from a fairy tale person who hasnt grafted or been in seriously destressed times with money. Positively does reflect on some occasions and I can agree with that buy not everything comes from thinking positive, as sometimes you have to physically make something happen.

  The book centres around the law of positive attraction. I think there is something in this, my mum always told me that our thoughts can bring aboout good or bad. It also highlights the power of the mind, for example the placebo efffect in drug trials, wheen the placebo works merely because a patient belives in it. That said,I dont think the book is well written, it is an odd format of quotes and commentary. Also i can see that this can be very damaaging and offensive tp those who had traumatic  events in their lives as it does imply that we bring on negative events onto ourselves.

I bought this book back into my life not because the book, but because it supports -I think- the experiences of people that have stragled through life and by BELIEVING found themselves in a better positon, achieving their dreams, whatever they were. Yes, you have to move your back side, luck doesn't exist, you make it happend, but for this, YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE , no in a type of God, or Cult, or Universe or any Law, but IN YOURSELF.

  Some may argue that why do people die? Did they attract death? The law of attraction has no scientific base no mathematics nothing! But the four forces of the universe have,plus string theory(which possibly can be the fifth force of the universe) so comparing “the law of attraction to the four forces of universe is 100% wrong.” However you are the master of your timeline you are in control of circumstances that occurs around you and full stop I don’t know why this book is trying to sell people that law of attraction is everything you need.

  This book is like suits (IMO)  first few chapters are strange and slightly nonsensical. However, as the book progresses it gets much better. I would not say this book is the best for affirmations or the secret of life however. If you keep thinking and never say or act - you won’t get anywhere . So , in the book where they say your thoughts attract it - I didn’t entirely agree . However , it is a great starting point and I couldn’t put it down towards the end.

  This book does outline some people's views on the law of attraction. At the same time it seems that the people who benefitted from this book would benefit more helpfully from books on cognitive behavioural therapy.

  This doesn’t even deserve one star, it’s not supported by any evidence and suggests that someone with an illness can be cured by simply watching funny films!

  I brought this as per recommendation from a friend. While it’s got some good ideas and concepts for living a happy life, I found the section on how thinking that your slim can make you slim a little too far fetched. Being a personal trainer, I know that it takes more effort than that and found that to be a bit misleading and unfair to people who struggle with their weight already.Nice idea, just not all entirely factual or helpful.

  I read the book only about three weeks ago. Since then, I've also read Rhonda Byrne's ""The Power"", and I'm part way through ""The Magic"".  I've scoured the internet for more information about the Law of Attraction.  At first, I only recognized that the Law has been working in my life for my whole life.  I have mostly attracted negative things in the past, not realizing what has been going on.  But realizing now that the Law is real has given me inspiration and faith.  I am now on a new path, and the Law is beginning to work for me; I have already attracted some good and amazing things.  But at this early stage, I still need to learn to trust the Law, and develop a greater faith in it.  This is a very personal journey, and it requires one to become more intimate with their thoughts, beliefs and desires.  It takes a measure of work and a bit of devotion.  ""The Secret"" doesn't provide everything needed in this journey, but it's an excellent starting point.

  Enormously interesting that, yet again, this kind of stuff can ""do"" and sell so well. My early 20s children like it - my generation's version was ""The Power of Positive Thinking"" by Norman Vincent Peel which basically 'preached' the same thing but with a bit less mumbo-jumbo. So it's not ""A Secret"" at all, just standard old-fashioned stuff that's been said a thousand times before in a thousand different ways .... but that said, OF COURSE it's better to be ""up"" & positive about life than to be got down by it.

  I read this about 10 years ago when it was first released. It was interesting but I put it away and didn't think of it again until recently. Many changes happened in my life over the past ten years. My father suffered a long illness and passed. My mother has been ill. I too became ill, I believe to be caused by stress.  These events were definitely life changing. I saw the book and decided to read it again. I think I was at a stage in my life that I could truly appreciate this book more. I can honestly say it has made a significant impact on the way I live my life. I am now reading another book in the series and am applying it every day. I am happier than I have ever been. I highly recommend these books.

  Gets you into deep thinking and makes you feel the importance of having faith in yourself and being grateful for everything you have. A magic potion to do away with negativity.

  I had high expectations following the hype around this book but was left disappointed.‘The Secret’ itself has merit, however I found it to be very repetitive throughout the book. In my opinion there are more engaging self help books out there.

  I thought this book would be different and interesting. I've never read a book about the laws of attraction ; but being quite an open minded person, I already knew the basics of it. I felt as if the book dragged the whole idea of thinking positive throughout the book - Losing interest in the book. I frankly did not enjoy it nor gained any new knowledge.

  If you are ready to take on board the Law of Attraction the this book is a must. I have given away so many copies that I have now bought it on Kindle so that I always have my own copy! It is very easy to read and take small sections of this book with you for thought. I like the fact that so many different and successful people have written in this book as it is easier to identify with some more than others.

  the book has a message, but the presentation is glitzy and looks like a shiny sales catalogue, so is expensive and has an air of salesmanship. I read the first third and skimmed the rest as the repetitive nature of the writing is irritating. This is not to say Byrne hasn't a point - she wants to remind us of what she believes is a, or even The secret to happiness, but the presentation smacks of a wide-eyed teenager discovering religion or sex.

However I am so glad that I read the book and have to say that my outlook on life has changed for the better.  Anyone who is apprehensive trust me you will be amazed once you've read it.  You have to have an open mind and be willing to admit to yourself where you've gone wrong to embrace the secret.

  It's incredible! Law of attraction is one of the most powerful things I've ever encountered. It's obvious it's working every day for every person. The only reason it won't work is if you don't believe in yourself and your own worth, hence the negative reviews! This has changed my life and the life of many around me.

  Somebody I know recently recommended me 'The Secret', telling me with tears in her eyes (literally) about how it transformed her life, and that she reads passages from it every day to cement its messages into her head. I must admit that I do dabble in flowery ""spiritual"" self-help books from time-to-time, and that I'm quite quick to defend them against the many detractors who stick their nose up at them and look down at the people who read them. The Dalai Lama's books, for instance, had an absolutely enormous impact on my life when I started reading them during my angst filled early 20s. I say this because I don't want you to think that I'm writing this review with any biases against spiritual and self-help books when I say that 'The Secret' by Rhonda Byrne is truly shocking. In fact, I can safely say that it's the single worst, most pretentious, unethical and downright idiotic book I've ever read in my life. I forced myself to finish the whole book, because I actually paid money for the damn thing, and by the end of it I actually felt angry. I don't remember the last time that a book made me feel angry, so I think Rhonda Byrne deserves a pat on the back for that.I didn't feel angry because the book was so badly written (which, indeed, it was), but because of the very premise of it, which has struck a chord with so many millions of people across the world since Oprah championed it on her TV show years ago. In numerous paragraphs, which basically repeat the same theme over and over again, Byrne and her collaborators nurture the most selfish materialistic view of life imaginable, preaching not a ""Gospel of Wealth"", but something even more sinister. At least that encourages the concept that you have to work hard to gain your wealth, and that giving to charity is good. Rather, Byrne et al preach the message that money and material possessions are everything that matters, that they're attainable only by merely thinking positively (in itself, not necessarily a bad message, but I'll get back to that later), and that anyone who doesn't have money, or has some other problem in their life, has brought it on themselves for thinking negatively. Victim of child abuse? Brought it on his/herself. The civil war in Syria? They brought it on themselves. But the banksters, the tax-evading CEOs and the sweatshop owners? They brought all their glorious wealth to themselves through making full use of the natural harmony of ""the universe"", thinking positively and being grateful for what they have, and they deserve it all.Now, focusing on positive thinking, visualisation exercises in helping you to achieve your dreams, etc., is a great thing. We know from science and psychology that the power of positive thinking is an incredible tool in helping people to recover from serious illnesses, make friends, get good jobs, etc., and this should be encouraged. One or two of the exercises suggested in this book are actually very good too. But this book peddles the idea that it's the only thing that matters, and it does so under the most wishy-washy flowery and pretentious language I've ever come across. This is a book designed for people who want quick fixes, people who would give anything to believe that you can win the lottery tomorrow by not just visualising it, but also convincing yourself that you've already won. If you're drowning in a sea of debt, you're told to convince yourself that you're a millionaire and then, when you truly believe it, you'll start having cheques coming through your letterbox out of nowhere instead of bills. This is neurotic. 'The Secret' is literally encouraging people to be crazy, to think only of their own self interests, and then (the worst part) to blame people who aren't rich, people who are depressed, people who just lost a parent, for thinking negative thoughts that caused all of their problems. This is an absolutely horrendous book in every conceivable way.

  There are some interesting observations about success and happiness and some viable ways to achieve it. However, many of the techniques offered are hard to believe. For example, 'know' that food doesn't make you put on weight and it wont; and if you believe you don't need reading glasses... hey presto... the next day you have 20/20 vision. Strange. Anyway, the book does make you think and if you believe strongly in the power of the mind you'll enjoy this book.

  I have read The Secret on my kindle and really enjoyed it. I wanted to buy a hard copy so now and again I can go back and re-read certain chapters. I was really disappointed when my copy arrived and quite a few of the pages were printed blurred. I obviously cant read these pages and feel someone should have checked the copies before selling them on as mine is probably not the only one.

  Reading this book is like being told about a great film by someone who saw it on a plane; shoddily related and in danger of ruining a good thing for you.You know what it's about by now. As a science student this book appalled me - the writing standard is shocking. There's no real structure, quotes are miscellaneous. If you read the first ten pages you can stop, because you won't learn anything new after that. If I handed this in to my lecturers, I thought, I'd be in real danger of failing, positive thinking or no.The worst part is that some really interesting ideas are presented here, they're just presented in such a frivolous manner! As if exclamation marks explain everything! It's infuriating, and a waste considering that a lot of people are discovering these ideas through this book. Frankly I cannot believe it was allowed into print as it stands. It simply isn't good enough.There's also a pervading attitude towards hard work that's at best misleading and at worst dangerous. The only mention of actually working towards your goals is to say that it should feel easy, when the success stories presented are of people who worked for it. I can't say whether it was easy for them or not, but the notion of working is completely skipped over. You could argue that getting what you want without working for it is the crux of this particular book, (though not necessarily the ideas it's based on), and this is an entirely personal viewpoint, but you shouldn't look to get through life without working for what you have. You'll be so much better for it. Bear in mind how biased that makes my review as I seem to disagree with the core of this book, but I can't help but feel I could be far more objective if the book in question were written by a more capable author.Clearly I've highlighted far too many flaws to recommend this book; it would lose none of its value if someone else read it and summed it up for you. By reading these reviews you've negated the need for it. If it's self-help you want I'm sure there are better sources out there. As an authority on the Law of Attraction it's worth a glance, (at someone else's copy), as long as you accept straight off that it's an interpretation, and a poorly written one at that.

  I've read countless books on self development over the years, some great and  some not so great. This definitely ranks in the not so great category. I've experienced a lot of success in my life and it comes down to three things. 1. Effort. 2 Attitude and 3. The way you treat other people. This book focuses on point 2. Whilst I am a huge advocate of having a positive outlook and nurturing the mind with positive thoughts and have daily rituals to that end some of the content in here is just absolute nonsense. Being on the same ""frequency"" as the universe ""getting whatever you want"" just by thinking it are the kind of concepts that give this industry a bad name. Thought without action accomplishes nothing.

  I enjoyed this book when I read it and have given copies to friends and family to read.  Take out the nonsense areas like its all your fault when something major goes wrong .... scary statement indeed, and some of it makes sense.  You can have so much more in life and all it takes is focus and belief ... if you can truly beleive it, you can acheive it.  So much of this is taken out of context and without the incredible power that comes from the great master himself Napoleon Hill.  I would urge you to read or listen to the 6 set cd series by napeleon hill ... Tony Robins and so many others have learnt and preach his teachings from almost 100 years ago ... it is the real thing !! The Science of Personal Acheivement. Its called.  Its the real Mccoy. Rhoda and some great gurus of today seem to have taken what he has said all that time ago and paraphrased it.  Hope you enjoy it !!  Its also downloadable if you look around.

  This is by no means the most thorough, complete or comprehensive book on using your mind and emotions to attract what you want in life, and it wasn't the first book about this topic that I'd personally come across either. Having said that, this work (both the book and the original film) has been a wonderful catalyst for introducing a large number of people to the concept of being able to actively draw your desires towards you by using the power of your mental faculties. I saw the film and then read the book for the first time years ago, when I was just emerging into adulthood. I'd previously come across a few works that spoke along similar lines, but the enthusiasm, simplicity and immediacy of this book's message really cemented the idea in my head that I could truly start trying to direct the content and direction of my life from within.It resulted in my first real life experiment in manifesting something for myself- an experiment which proved to be an immediate success. While walking through a large department store looking for a birthday gift for my best friend (we always spent $50 on each other), I realised I was broke- I had another week before pay day, and I desperately needed to buy more petrol for my car so I could keep going to uni that week, and I had less than $100 in the bank. Buying my friend's gift was basically more than I could afford that week. I thought to myself, ""If only I had an extra $50 to tide me over for the week- that's all I'd need to get through till pay day."" I decided to attract the money. I just sort of mentally projected the request for $50, then immediately stopped thinking about it, acted as though it was done. Three minutes later I literally stepped on a $50 note in an abandoned section of the car park, nowhere near any cars or people who may have dropped it. That day, thanks to this book, I really realised I had a concrete ability to positively effect my own life.

  Nel dvd in italiano vengono cambiate frasi, significati, tagliati tanti pezzi, se comprendete bene l'inglese almeno ad un livello medio, vi conviene la versione in inglese, piuttosto traducete parola per parola, ma non fidatevi della traduzione in italiano, come nel film in dvd, il vero segreto non ve lo voglio svelare pienamente.Putroppo non solo in Italia, in tanti paesi dove è stato tradotto male, forse apposta, non  rendono l'idea di cosa sia davvero il segreto e come usarlo, ad esempio è successo anche in Giappone, un paese dove di solito la precisione ed obbligo.

  Please ingnore the neg comments and buy the cd audio version! its worth every penny!!!!In my view the negative comments are miss-understanding what the secret is trying to get across, though for me the secret is very obvious & beautifully put, but then I am trained in neuro-science and matters of the unconscious mind, and once you understand how the brain works then its easy to understand how the secret can work.The main thread of 'the secret' is NOT about positive thinking, or wishing.The main thread or principle to create change is about taking time out to 'imaginine' your desired self (in a realistic way of course).If you take time out each day to sit down close your eyes and imagine your desired self often, then its far more likely you will attain it, because its scientifically proven that the brain does not know you are imagining, thus the brain thinks what you run though your imagination 'is real' and hence it eventually acts accordingly if you have imagined your desired self many times, the trick being to do it often.I use imagining methods with my clients all the time and their lives completely transform, & you only need to read the positive reviews which also reflect this.Indeed people are right in saying that positive thinking alone wont do much in the long run and thats true! but the KEY in 'the secret' is ""IMAGINING"" imagining your desired self (realistically).I would strongly encourage people to buy the cd version and NOT the book, the cd is so much more inspiring and its so much more understandable listening to the cd. I've done both & the cd is miles more effective & empowering.The law of attraction works both ways and so for those who believe it to be rubbish then it will be so for them because that is what they believe and have attracted to them selves, its just the law of attraction working in reverse!The only bit I dont like about the secret is a slight christian thread that runs through it which i feel is imposing on people and disrespectful to those who have a different religious belief so that is why i have only give it 4 stars.

  I purchased this book after reading a review about it.  At the time I was in a job that I struggled with and I felt very down about myself.Within the first half an hour of reading I quickly learned that my own perspective of things had to change.  The book is about 'The laws of attraction' basicaly meaning that to get good things in your life you must see the positive as negativity attracts negativity.  It makes you stop and think about how your mood and thoughts can change everything and everyone around you.There are topics on using 'The Secret' in relationships and love, money, health and life.  These are in easy readable sections and have a summary at the end of each.  There are also thought provoking quotes from writers throughout.Some of the writers, who have contributed to this book, have helped people to become self fulfilled, high flying business people and millionaires just by using the mind power of positivity.  This book teaches you to say 'I will' and 'I can' instead of 'I won't' or 'I can't'.I am pleased to say that since reading this book, I have identified my stresses and I am making changes for the better.  Well worth a read.

  I believed in inner power and the substance of the Universe, however my life was still extremely frustrating at times and i didn't know why. Several years ago somebody recommended the DVD of The Secret to me so i went with it and, after watching it, felt totally inspired, so much so I handed my notice in at work to develop myself.A couple of years later and the biggest change was in my mind and mental outlook on life. The Secret set me on a journey of discovering the original new thought authors from late 1800's and slowly, but surely, I have seen changes. Last year I discovered two authors and everything clicked into place, namely Neville Goddard and Joanne St.Clair. These authors really heightened the journey of discovery which The Secret set me on, resulting in a six figure lottery win earlier this year.I would definately recommend this book and the DVD, but just sticking to this and nothing else is not enough. If you really want change you must keep discovering your inner Spirit and its relationships to life. Neville taught me more about the imagination and its use, and Joanne St.Clair put it all into perspective in a very modern and down to earth way.Enjoy.

  Ich halte mich für einen rationalen und skeptischen Menschen, deshalb bin ich vorsichtig und mit wenig Erwartungen an das Buch herangegangen. Dennoch hat mich The Secret überzeugt. Auch wenn ich glaube es kratzt nur an der Oberfläche, werden hier viele augenöffnenden Momente vermittelt, die einem doch zum Nachdenken bringen. Sehr spannend!Habe The Secret im Juli 2016 gelesen und den Film geschaut (ist identisch, aber doppelt hält besser :)) und lebe seit dem viel aufmerksamer/bewusster. Bsp: Welche Worte spreche ich oder schreibe ich (in Whats App zB). Welche negativen Gedanken schwirren mir so durch den Kopf den ganzen Tag lang? So wenige negative Formulierungen/Gedanken wie möglich, dafür austauschen gegen schöne Themen. Ich bin jeden Tag dankbar für einige Dinge und spüre deutlicher Glücksmomente muss ich sagen.Ich bilde mir ein dass ich seit dem viel positiver, leichter und glücklicher lebe.

  The trouble with this book is that they are missing a component out.  Sure, the Law of Attraction works because if exhibit positive body language and express yourself in positive words and phrases, you will attract positive people to you, allowing your to make social and business connections to helf you achieve your goals.However, I have a problem with the idea that you just have to think and believe something and it will happen.  What Byrne has missed out is: you have to put in ""pathways"" to make your visualisation come true. For example, if you want a better physique, you can visualise how you want to look and feel, but then you have to go to the gym regularly and avoid fatty foods!

Let me tell you forcing yourself to be happy and believe in such things makes for Major disapointment you have to except you arent going to get most things you want in life as thats just the way it is, the book has more holes in than a sieve please dont waste your money just live you life try to be happy and be grateful for what you have as soon as I stopped asking and thinking positive thoughts 24/7 I was more happy and not exhausted at trying to be what a normal human is we are emotional, moody angry and some of us tainted by life but so what thats what makes us unique buy the happiness trap it makes a lot more sense to except what you have rather than expecting the world to fall on your lap.

  This was a concept I have been aware of for many years, only this book has more detail of how to use the law of attraction. Cosmic ordering is another term widely used. It makes sense, and appears to be backed up by quantum physics. It's really an option and belief system that one might adopt, and is an alternative to other belief sytems out there.  I personally would say there have been elements of thruth to this in my experience. For instance thinking of a person, and somehow you bump into them a few days later, or they give you a call out of the blue...that's one example of the law of attraction. we do tend to complain about many things and not the positive in our lives, which the book says only serves to draw more negative experiences to us. We would need to remain positive and feel good, (if that is possible) to ensure only good things enter our lives. The law of attraction it says is always working and mirrors our thoughts.  These dominant thoughts will enter our lives, this energy going out into the universe and returning to source. Our lives are a mirror of our thoughts. That is the law of attraction it states, and is in perfect balance. For those looking to change something in there lives Byrne's book is worthy of consideration, but may take some time to accept for others if at all.

  Although the book is divided into topics, such as relationships, money and health, advice on how to manifest is spread very thinly throughout the book. I also think that at least fifty percent of the content in this book is just written to fill the pages instead of helping readers to manifest whatever they want; especially the interviews are mainly about how great the Secret is, what those people manifested in their own lives and what could be possible using the Secret – but no advice on how to manifest more effectively. Basically, “The Secret” just takes a look at the tip of the iceberg. There are better, more practical books about the Law of Attraction out there. Nevertheless, if you are new to spiritual topics, “The Secret” can give you an idea of what the Law of Attraction is all about.

  This book is centred around the law of attraction, ie. if you think positive thoughts your life experiences will be positive and vice versa.  I found it very thought provoking.However I found it over the top in places, and I can't agree with some of the opinions expressed - eg. on the one hand the universe operates on the law of love but on the other it is indifferent to how we behave, also that human beings are the sole creators of the universe.I found the plethora of quotations made the book very disjointed, and would have preferred a developing narrative with a reasoned argument.On the other hand - some fascinating ideas about the power of the mind, and a challenging reminder that we can write the story of our own lives.

  The Secret is a very simple truth which has its roots in several religious teachings but the book is not “religious”.  The author merely seeks to share the information that we have the power to make changes in our lives by speaking & thinking positive thoughts.  We can change our focus & bring joy & happiness instead of negative thoughts which manifest in harmful ways.  I recommend reading The Secret, you can have control over your mind.

  O watched the film version on Netflix and thought the book would delve more deeply into the law of attraction. Turns out the entire franchise is nothing more than a brilliant marketing campaign. I will definitely give them that. After the book, all I was left with was the sad realization that the Law of attraction really is just that: a mystical makeover for greed. If you just concentrate hard enough in the shiny material things you want, they'll magically and effortlessly gravitate to you... Somehow!

Nonostante sia stato un libro molto commerciale, a suo tempo, si trovano degli spunti interessanti che in altri testi di questo tipo sono fumosi e non diretti con qui. Lo consiglio anche in versione kindle

  A fantastic book that EVERYBODY should read. It really kick-started my life and changed it for the better. It doesn't patronize, it's easy to understand, and it's very practical. It made me re-evaluate and re-think everything, and I've seen wonderful results already! Seriously, buy the book already!

  I felt this book is very motivational and positivity booster. I recommend every person should read this atleast once in a life time to increase our positivity.This book has experinces of many people that inspire us be positive in all circumstances of life. Once we read this in our bad time, it encourages us to think about good thoughts. If i get negative thoughts, i just go through this book to get my positive feelings back.Even though this book has fake editions , i have received a nice edition with good paper quality and binding which makes me read all the time.

  I was recommended this book by my counsellor, who advised me to take some of the advice with a bit of salt, but the whole time I was reading it (I managed two chapters) I kept thinking of that IT Crowd episode where Douglas becomes a Spaceologist (""Something Happened"") and couldn't stop laughing enough to carry on as it reads exactly like Spaceologist propaganda.It is like a giant advertisement where they just repeat the same sentiment using slightly different phrasing as there is simply not enough actual content to fill the book, other than the condescending crap about how everything wrong in your life is your fault because you're thinking about it wrong. The whole book can be summarised as ""Think positive thoughts and you will be more aware of positive things in your life and have a more positive outlook"". Reading that quote means you have basically read the whole book without having to also read actual quotes such as “Food cannot cause you to put on weight, unless you think it can.” or “The only reason any person does not have enough money is because they are blocking money from coming to them with their thoughts.” - what a load of drivel.Total waste of money.

  I think this book is very useful for people who don't realise that each one is responsible to everything that happens to them.If you understand that already, or if you have read about NLP and CBT, I think the book will ""sound"" boring and uninteresting to you.You know that you have different ways to explain the same thing to a child and to an adult?I think you would use NLP and CBT to explain some of those concepts to an experienced person, and ""the secret"" to explain it to a dummy (no offense intended).Although I did not like the book, I will give it 4 stars because it made a huge success among everyone I lent it to.

  First off, I do like this book and also The Power.  They encourage positivity and gratitude which are good things and can help you in life because positivity and gratitude make people want to help you out and give you things and I believe that a lot  of people have changed their lives, gained health, wealth and happiness by following the words in this book.However, the Law of Attraction is only one force in the universe, of which there are many and seeing the LOA as the one and only force in the universe can be dangerous in that it can re-victimise, for example, a victim of rape.  A teenage girl is walking down the street on her way home from a friend's house, it's gone dark but she hasn't got far to go and she feels safe in her neighbourhood and bam, she gets raped - she blames herself, as most victims of this crime do, it isn't her fault and she felt safe enough walking, feeling positive and yet, this other force attacked her.  This kind of thing happens all the time.  Is it really a good idea for a person to think that the relative that sexually assaulted her or the group of kids that relentlessly bullied him or the car that came out of nowhere and collided with their car is the fault of the person that got hurt, that they were attracting it and they could have done something different to prevent it?  That is the kind of thinking that they need to be encouraged out of.  If a person is hurt or injured they need loving words of encouragement, not ""it's your fault, you must have wanted it"".I wouldn't like to think of a person walking down the street thinking ""the world is a lovely place and I attract nothing but lovely things to me"" and not being vigilant to dark corners and alleyways and other people around them. I wouldn't like to think of a person being conned out of a large amount of money thinking that because they're being kind and positive that that is what they will always get in return.  I also wouldn't like someone to read this book and ignore their instincts when it is trying to tell them something because they've read a book that says you get what you give out and giving out positivity means that's what is coming back.  There are a lot of people that take advantage of such a naive outlook on life.It is a very good book and a very good concept but it's not the be all and end all of a perfect happy life.  Gratitude and a positive attitude work very well when used with common sense and listening to your instincts and remembering that the Law of Attraction is not the only force in the universe.

  Aujourd'hui, ce fameux ''secret'' n'en est plus un. il existe une multitude de livres sur le sujet, encore plus de vidéos sur youtube et de nombreuses personnes en font leur commerce. Cependant, je trouve ce petit livre très intéressant même pour ceux qui s'y connaissent déjà très bien. Parfois, nous avons besoin d'entendre à plusieurs reprises la même information pour qu'elle ''tilte'' enfin ! Nous avons aussi parfois besoin d'un petit rappel, et ce sont là les rôles de ce livre (pour ceux qui sont familiers avec la Loi de l'Attraction en tout cas). De surcroît, le livre est très joli. En complément, je conseillerais les écrits de Joseph Murphy (The Power of your subsconscious Mind).

  This book is a must have in any persons collection. What i love about this book it makes no reflection on religon as it refers to the Universe. This for me makes it an inspiring read for every walk of life. The book makes you want to keep reading all the time as it is full of positive and yet true on what we think comes to us at some time in our lives and trust me this does happen. The quality of the book does it for me and it feels some what magical. I try to read it almost every night so when i go to sleep my mind has comforting thoughts ready for my next working day. So much goodness has happened to me after reading 'THE SECRET' and i can be doubtful about alot of things but you can make things turn arround and bring more love, joy and positivity arround you. I have purchased a couple more copies for xmas present because i believe it does work. My daughter loves it too and thats a first.You will not be disappointed so if i were you i would get a copy for your collection. Happy reading!!!

It encourages ""magical thinking"".Reading it may well get you all pumped up to make changes in your life, but for £5.79 do youreally expect to see much lasting change?The law of attraction does not work by itself. It may work as a method of motivation to takeaction and actually make things happen. But it doesn't matter how long I spend visualizinga BMW in my drive - one isn't just going to appear.

  I, like many people bought this book after hearing all the hype.  I read it quite quickly and found it an inspiring read.  However, I did find it a little repetitive at times, with the same point being made over and over again by different people, ie you will manifest what you think about. The basic message itself is a positive one and if we can all be encouraged to think more positively that can only be a good thing. The use of visualisation and focusing on the positive are all great tools to have as you are then more likely to be drawn to good things, be more in touch with your intuition and to notice opportunities. However, sometimes we might start out thinking we want something and then discover it isn't what we wanted afterall, so the ability to be open minded to adapt our goals and desires are also important.If you want to make improvements to your life then this is a good place to start.  However, to make long lasting changes, then I truly believe that more is required than just postive thinking, such as setting goals, taking action and developing resilience. If you want a book that helps you achieve all this, then I would recommend adding a little Serendipity to your Secret and read the fantastic

  Rhonda Byrne wrote a good synthesis of the New Thought approach.  Her aesthetic-looking book really reveals  the key to success in whatever field you choose. Yes, life is the reflection of what we feel deep inside ( see the concept of ANIMA with Jungian psychologists, for example.) What if you left the 《  it's awful - club  》 for the 《 it's OK and even marvelous-club  》? FEEL that and only  judge from the results in your life even if old  thinking habits seem to die hard....Try  it. It works.

  The book is interesting but there is so much redundancy, too much until you think when I will move to the next idea. I found many concepts already exist in many religions, I predicated that I will get really something different :(Sending the signals in the universe and wait until you get the response :) great :) but in case I did not get it I still have to believe that there is something went wrong because it is not the normal case !!!!!!! so does our universe organised ? Is there a system ?

  I bought the CD's along with the DVD as a different method to take the information in.  I have to say its inspiring. If there is nothing on the radio in the car I want to hear I put the CD's on and listen.  Like a subliminal way of learning too.  I still need to get my head around the time is an illusion theory but I will get there.  I am finding myself putting many negative thoughts to one side now.  Sometimes I need to figure out why I have them but mostly they are repetitive and serve no purpose.  I want to tell all my friends but have resisted the temptation because I think you are drawn to the SECRET when you are ready to hear it.  LOA at work again.  Great buy for me.

  After ordering The Secret I was very unsure as to what it was going to teach me but after reading the first few chapters I could feel myself becoming more empowered and positive about the various situations in my life. I have to say it's sometimes difficult to maintain my positive thinking but without question I have found it beneficial to all aspects in my life. I appear to certainly be attracting the opposite sex (without even trying)and my professional career is becoming very interesting, to say the least???I find myself re-reading certain areas to re tune my thoughts, maintaining my positivity and eliminating the negative thoughts that try to incroach on my psychy!Excellent self-help book, in particular for those of a spiritual mind!

  A good book that is a good easy read and offers a positive message. After reading this I have read many of the other books of the people quoted in this book so anyone saying this book is basic I think that's how the author meant it to be if you want to look into this further the basic info is there for you research further. A good book that I would definitely recommend that can lead you onto reading more complex and deeper reading. The book delivers a positive message  so if you can take the positives from it then good if you can't and still try and knock it I think you've missed the point.

  I am finding the secret very powerful as a tool for changing my daily life around. I am learning how to focus my energy in a positive way, put out there what I want in a positive way and find it easier being positive about people and things. I am working with the ask, believe and receive and am trying to believe that I have received from just believing and find it helps me to go about my day in a more positive manner.It is a useful tool for believing in a higher power and I have learnt that you can tell your higher power any thing you want about your day and positive stuff happens, even stuff in your day that might seem negative and difficult to face get esasier as does communication with people. I try to reflect stuff back that comes at me negatively in a positive way however this doesn't happen all the time depending on whether the person is open to receive or not but certainly it is easier putting your point of view across, you get listened to and it doesn't feel as scary to deal with people especially if those people carry authority and I have found it easier finding jobs to apply for since reading the secret, I am getting responses to job applications and also find it easier filling in my job searches because I am more positively focused and driven.

I go into each day with positive outlook, and try to look for the positive in everything around me, and I can honestly say these books have helped me immensly.I am hoping as my positivity grows stronger, that this will indeed come back to me, but for now, I am happy I am making it through each day with a smile and a positive outlook to the future.

  I have been reading up on the Law of Attraction and as you know one book leads to another leads to another and so on.  I bought the film and the book but wish I had just bought the film now as they are both EXACT word for word.  I prefer to watch and listen than to read.  However the message in it is one everyone should hear.  I now know what the Secret is, it's the same Jack Canfield, John Assaraf and others tell us about but summed up from several of them.  However the book/film tells us its about mindset then place your order yet Neale Donald Walsch (Conversations with God) says it's not just that.  I don't want to ruin it for you but pick one and see for yourself if you are into this sort of thing.

  There is no secret I am afraid! ""The Secret"" is just a long drawn out way to encourage positive thinking. I would have preferred a more straightforward read with a book about positive thinking. Do not for heaven's sake make my mistake of buying the audio book; it is accompanied by mysterious music and sounds!! Really off putting. The bit that annoyed me is that it gives the impression that if you find out ""The Secret"" you will come into lots of money. Utter nonsense. Yes you can earn lots of money if you work hard and have the right (positive) attitude but it's not going to just happen because you have  bought the book. The author is coming into lots of money though by selling so many!!I'll let you into a secret - I wish I hadn't bought it!!!!

  Believer or non believer, religious or agnostic, sceptic or guilable, I can find no reason to doubt or ridicule this idea.  Could be you just want some positivity in your life.  Could be you think this is just the biggest discovery since fire, or the wheel!  Could be you think this is just good old fashioned common sense.  Many parallels with religion,  or you may feel there is a strong scientific basis in all that is said.  Personally, I have watched, listened, and read, and I cannot really fault this work, as it works for me on a multitude of layers, as long as you leave your irrational fears and doubts at the door, and consider with a fearless, open mind, then you have nothing to lose, and a more positive, optimistic outlook to life to gain.  I like it.

  If you are going through a bad patch whether it be issues at work or home or in your personal life; or you feel that life has nothing to offer you or any negative feelings you may have;  i urge you to read this book and if you can also watch the secret by Rhonda Bryne.  My life has been a roller-coaster of all of the above mentioned but since a friend referred this book to me together with the DVD The Secret and also Daily Teachings, my attitude to life has changed completely.  I read thousands of positive thinking quotes and Buddhism quotes etc but its Rhonda Byrnes books and DVD that has made changes in my life. I'm recommending this book and dvd to my friends.  My daughter is sitting her GCSEs in the next couple of weeks and she'll be watching this movie this weekend to instil positivity in her and give her all the confidence she needs to see the next few weeks through and the future too

  Our mindsets are programmed by our parents ,teachers,friends and those we interact with . This is especially true in our formative years. And its mostly wrong, indeed negative, so to rebalance your mindset to other possibilities read this book.Both my wife ,daughter and myself have found inspiration ,solace and a stronger mindset as a result.The smarter mankind has become the more detached we have become from our world , universe and each other!someone once said "" There's more in heaven and earth than man can comprehend"" this book I believe plugs some of the gaps.If for no other reason than to rechallenge our preconceived ideas this is as good a possibility as any idea of what lifes about.

  This book is a fabulous read which I've put into practice on a small scale, e.g. a seat on the train on my commute has been available 90% of the time since reading this book.  This is a good gift for everyone, especially those who appear to have a lot of bad luck!  Turn the luck around with this book.  Enjoy!

  However, the whole book is a very cheap rip off of Think and Grow Rich which is way better and authentic.

  Un livre qui fait réfléchir, quoi nous rappelle les choses importantes dans la vie, même la texture & l'écriture donnent envie de le lire & ça complète les autres livres (aussi intéressants) de R Byrne, si vous êtes fan. Merci.Thank you!

  Après avoir lu le livre une première fois de façon classique, je l'ai rangé dans ma table de chevet pour pouvoir en lire quelques passages le matin avant de me lever. Ainsi je commence ma journée sur une belle note et j'assimile petit à petit les principes du livre (ou plutôt le seul et unique principe).
